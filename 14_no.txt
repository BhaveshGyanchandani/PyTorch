2 | NarrativeText | aa? Ultrasound technology allows doctors to “see inside a patient without resorting to surgery. A transmit- ter sends high frequency sound waves into the body, where they bounce off the different tissues and organs to produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver “hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a computer, which translates the data into an image on a television screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish subtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is particularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the abdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment. | No
3 | Title | Purpose | No
4 | NarrativeText | The potential medical applications of ultrasound were first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of the sonar technology developed to detect submarines during World War IL. The first useful medical images were pro- duced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali- ty had improved to the point that it came into general medical use. Improvements in the technology, applica- tion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its low cost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into the top drawer of medical imaging techniques. | No
5 | NarrativeText | While pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com- monly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy, ultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominal imaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech- nologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better than plain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of soft tissue structures, and can be used in any of several modes, depending on the need at hand. | No
6 | NarrativeText | As an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally is warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acute abdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus- pected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan- creatic disease, gallstones, spleen disease, kidney dis- ease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Specifically: ¢ Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can signal a serious problem—from organ malfunction or injury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasound scanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten- tial causes when presented with general or ambiguous symptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can be studied for signs of disease that appear as changes in size, shape and internal structure. | No
7 | ListItem | Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as a car crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured abdominal organs is often the most serious threat to survival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are immediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as an initial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and it can be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severity of hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds, from a bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreign object and provide a preliminary survey of the damage. The easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech- nology has brought it into common emergency room use, and even into limited ambulance service. | No
8 | ListItem | ¢ Abdominal mass. Abnormal growths—tumors, cysts, abscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs—can be located and tentatively identified with ultrasound. In particular, potentially malignant solid tumors can be distinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and abscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ or part of the abdomen can be found. | No
9 | ListItem | Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liver disease are numerous, though jaundice tends to be a general symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate between many of the types and causes of liver malfunction, and is particularly good at identifying obstruction of the bile ducts and cirrhosis, which is characterized by abnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow. | No
10 | ListItem | Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation of the pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as are pancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt proper functioning. | No
11 | ListItem | Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions than any other digestive malady. These calculi can cause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and also obstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes from the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall- stones are readily identifiable with ultrasound. | No
12 | ListItem | Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to injury during abdominal trauma. It may also become painfully inflamed when beset with infection or cancer. These conditions also lend themselves well to ultrasonic inspection and diagnosis. | No
13 | ListItem | Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic injury and are the organs most likely to form calculi, which can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi- soning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing distinct changes in kidney morphology can also lead to com- plete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has proven extremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders. | No
14 | ListItem | Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak spot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood directly from the heart to the entire lower body. These aneurysms are relatively common and increase in prevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi- nently life-threatening. However, they can be readily identified and monitored with ultrasound before acute complications result. | No
15 | NarrativeText | Ultrasound technology can also be used for treat- ment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during surgical procedures—such as guiding needle placement to drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for biopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications for ultrasound are being developed. | No
16 | NarrativeText | The direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies in their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just like audible sound, and vibrate the materials through which they pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice- able at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging. Properly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound can be used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues. | No
17 | NarrativeText | High-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat soft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associated scarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro- mote rapid healing through increased circulation. Strong- ly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound can also be used to physically destroy certain types of tumors, as well as gallstones and other types of calculi. Developing new treatment applications for ultrasound is an active area of medical research. | No
18 | Title | Precautions | No
19 | NarrativeText | Properly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtually without risk or side effects. Some patients report feeling a slight tingling and/or warmth while being scanned, but most feel nothing at all. Ultrasound waves of appropriate frequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggra- vate any medical condition, though any woman who thinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue with her doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound. | No
20 | NarrativeText | The value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool, however, depends greatly on the quality of the equipment used and the skill of the medical personnel operating it. Improperly performed and/or interpreted, ultrasound can be worse than useless if it indicates that a problem exists where there is none, or fails to detect a significant condi- tion. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpen- sive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment can perform the procedure whether qualified or not. Patients should not hesitate to verify the credentials of techni- cians and doctors performing ultrasounds, as well as the quality of the equipment used and the benefits of the pro- posed procedure. | No
21 | NarrativeText | In cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment tool, patients should educate themselves about the proposed procedure with the help of their doctors—as is appropri- ate before any surgical procedure. Also, any abdominal ultrasound procedure, diagnostic or therapeutic, may be hampered by a patient’s body type or other factors, such as the presence of excessive bowel gas (which is opaque to ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are often not good candidates for abdominal ultrasound. | No
22 | Title | Description | No
23 | NarrativeText | Ultrasound includes all sound waves above the fre- quency of human hearing—about 20 thousand hertz, or cycles per second. Medical ultrasound generally uses fre- quencies between one and 10 million hertz (1-10 MHz). | No
24 | Title | KEY TERMS | No
25 | NarrativeText | Accessory organ—A lump of tissue adjacent to an organ that is similar to it, but which serves no important purpose, if functional at all. While not necessarily harmful, such organs can cause prob- lems if they grow too large or become cancerous. In any case, their presence points to an underlying abnormality in the parent organ. | No
26 | NarrativeText | Benign—In medical usage, benign is the opposite of malignant. It describes an abnormal growth that is stable, treatable and generally not life-threatening. | No
27 | NarrativeText | and expensive to perform, and they use ionizing electromagnetic radiation. | No
28 | NarrativeText | Doppler—The Doppler effect refers to the apparent change in frequency of sound wave echoes returning to a stationary source from a moving target. If the object is moving toward the source, the frequency increases; if the object is moving away, the frequen- cy decreases. The size of this frequency shift can be used to compute the object's speed—be it a car on the road or blood in an artery. The Doppler effect holds true for all types of radiation, not just sound. | No
29 | NarrativeText | Biopsy—the surgical removal and analysis of a tis- sue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, the term refers to the collection and analysis of tissue from a suspected tumor to establish malignancy. | No
30 | NarrativeText | Calculus—Any type of hard concretion (stone) in the body, but usually found in the gallbladder, pan- creas and kidneys. They are formed by the accumu- lation of excess mineral salts and other organic material such as blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) can cause problems by lodging in and obstructing the proper flow of fluids, such as bile to the intestines or urine to the bladder. | No
31 | NarrativeText | Cirrhosis—A chronic liver disease characterized by the invasion of connective tissue and the degenera- tion of proper functioning—jaundice is often an accompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis include alcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges- tive heart disease. | No
32 | NarrativeText | Common bile duct—The branching passage through which bile—a necessary digestive enzyme—travels from the liver and gallbladder into the small intestine. Digestive enzymes from the pancreas also enter the intestines through the com- mon bile duct. | No
33 | NarrativeText | Computed tomography scan (CT scan)—A special- ized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused and relatively low energy radiation to produce detailed two-dimensional images of soft tissue structures, particularly the brain. CT scans are the chief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higher quality images not disrupted by bone or gas. They are, however, more cumbersome, time consuming Frequency—Sound, whether traveling through air or the human body, produces vibrations—mole- cules bouncing into each other—as the shock wave travels along. The frequency of a sound is the num- ber of vibrations per second. Within the audible range, frequency means pitch—the higher the fre- quency, the higher a sound's pitch. | No
34 | NarrativeText | lonizing radiation—Radiation that can damage liv- ing tissue by disrupting and destroying individual cells at the molecular level. All types of nuclear radiation—x rays, gamma rays and beta rays—are potentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibrate the material through which they pass, but do not ionize it. | No
35 | NarrativeText | Jaundice—A condition that results in a yellow tint to the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in the liver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediate cause, but the underlying cause could be as simple as obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall- stone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound can distinguish between these conditions. | No
36 | NarrativeText | Malignant—The term literally means growing worse and resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym for cancerous and connotes a harmful condition that generally is life-threatening. | No
37 | NarrativeText | Morphology—Literally, the study of form. In medi- cine, morphology refers to the size, shape and structure rather than the function of a given organ. As a diagnostic imaging technique, ultrasound facil- itates the recognition of abnormal morphologies as symptoms of underlying conditions. | No
38 | NarrativeText | Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce more detailed images, but are also more readily absorbed and so cannot penetrate as deeply into the body. Abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequencies between 2-5 MHz. | No
39 | NarrativeText | An ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the transducer and the analyzer. The transducer both produces the sound waves that penetrate the body and receives the reflected echoes. Transducers are built around piezoelec- tric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric refers to electricity that is produced when you put pressure on certain crystals such as quartz). These ceramic chips react to electric puls- es by producing sound waves ( they are transmitting waves) and react to sound waves by producing electric pulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric puls- es supplied to the transducer causes it to produce the scanning sound waves. The transducer then receives the returning echoes, translates them back into electric pulses and sends them to the analyzer—a computer that orga- nizes the data into an image on a television screen. | No
40 | NarrativeText | Because sound waves travel through all the body’s tissues at nearly the same speed—about 3,400 miles per hour—the microseconds it takes for each echo to be received can be plotted on the screen as a distance into the body. The relative strength of each echo, a function of the specific tissue or organ boundary that produced it, can be plotted as a point of varying brightness. In this way, the echoes are translated into a picture. Tissues surrounded by bone or filled with gas (the stomach, intestines and bowel) cannot be imaged using ultrasound, because the waves are blocked or become randomly scattered. | No
41 | NarrativeText | Four different modes of ultrasound are used in med- ical imaging: « A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in which a single transducer scans a line through the body with the echoes plotted on screen as a function of depth. This method is used to measure distances within the body and the size of internal organs. Therapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the destructive wave energy. | No
42 | ListItem | B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans- ducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on screen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100 transducers in sequence form the basis for these most commonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000. | No
43 | ListItem | M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid sequence of B-mode scans whose images follow each other in sequence on screen enables doctors to see and mea- sure range of motion, as the organ boundaries that produce reflections move relative to the probe. M- | No
44 | NarrativeText | mode ultrasound has been put to particular use in studying heart motion. | No
45 | ListItem | Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonography includes the capability of accurately measuring velocities of moving material, such as blood in arteries and veins. The prin- ciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measure the speed of a car on the highway. Doppler capability is most often combined with B-mode scanning to produce images of blood vessels from which blood flow can be directly measured. This technique is used extensively to investigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hyper- tension, particularly in the heart, but also in the abdom- inal aorta and the portal vein of the liver. These machines cost about $250,000. | No
46 | NarrativeText | The actual procedure for a patient undergoing an abdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless of the type of scan or its purpose. Fasting for at least eight hours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach is empty and as small as possible, and that the intestines and bowels are relatively inactive. Fasting also allows the gall bladder to be seen, as it contracts after eating and may not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, a full bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the way so that the gas they contain does not disrupt the image. The patient’s abdomen is then greased with a special gel that allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across the skin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses. | No
47 | NarrativeText | This procedure is conducted by a doctor with the assistance of a technologist skilled in operating the equipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen to obtain different views of the target areas. The patient will likely be asked to change positions from side to side and to hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desired views. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal. | No
48 | NarrativeText | The many types and uses of ultrasound technology makes it difficult to generalize about the time and costs involved. Relatively simple imaging—scanning a suspi- cious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm—will take about half an hour to perform and will cost a few hundred dollars or more, depending on the quality of the equipment, the operator and other fac- tors. More involved techniques such as multiple M-mode and Doppler-enhanced scans, or cases where the targets not well defined in advance, generally take more time and are more expensive. | No
49 | NarrativeText | Regardless of the type of scan used and the potential difficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster and less expensive than computed tomography scans (CT), its primary rival in abdominal imaging. Furthermore, as abdominal ultrasounds are generally undertaken as “medically necessary” procedures designed to detect the presence of suspected abnormalities, they are covered under most types of major medical insurance. As always, though, the patient would be wise to confirm that their coverage extends to the specific procedure proposed. For nonemergency situations, most underwriters stipulate prior approval as a condition of coverage. | No
50 | NarrativeText | Specific conditions for which ultrasound may be selected as a treatment option—certain types of tumors, lesions, kidney stones and other calculi, muscle and lig- ament injuries, etc.—are described in detail under the appropriate entries in this encyclopedia. | No
51 | Title | Preparation | No
52 | NarrativeText | A patient undergoing abdominal ultrasound will be advised by their physician about what to expect and how to prepare. As mentioned above, preparations generally include fasting and arriving for the procedure with a full bladder, if necessary. This preparation is particularly use- ful if the gallbladder, ovaries or veins are to be examined. | No
53 | Title | Aftercare | No
54 | NarrativeText | In general, no aftercare related to the abdominal ultrasound procedure itself is required. | No
55 | Title | Risks | No
56 | NarrativeText | Abdominal ultrasound carries with it no recognized risks or side effects, if properly performed using appropri- ate frequency and intensity ranges. Sensitive tissues, par- ticularly those of the reproductive organs, could possibly sustain damage if violently vibrated by overly intense ultrasound waves. In general though, such damage would only result from improper use of the equipment. | No
57 | NarrativeText | Any woman who thinks she might be pregnant should raise this issue with her doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound, as a fetus in the early stages of development could be injured by ultrasound meant to probe deeply recessed abdominal organs. | No
58 | Title | Normal results | No
59 | NarrativeText | As a diagnostic imaging technique, a normal abdom- inal ultrasound is one that indicates the absence of the suspected condition that prompted the scan. For example, symptoms such as a persistent cough, labored breathing, and upper abdominal pain suggest the possibility of, among other things, an abdominal aortic aneurysm. An ultrasound scan that indicates the absence of an aneurysm would rule out this life-threatening condition and point to other, less serious causes. | No
60 | Title | Abnormal results | No
61 | NarrativeText | Because abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally undertaken to confirm a suspected condition, the results of a scan often will prove abnormal—that is they will confirm the diagnosis, be it kidney stones, cirrhosis of the liver or an aortic aneurysm. At that point, appropriate medical treatment as prescribed by a patient’s doctor is in order. See the relevant disease and disorder entries in this encyclopedia for more information. | No

89 | NarrativeText | Many unexpected and fascinating events occur dur- ing the development of a fetus inside the womb. The stomach and intestines begin development outside the baby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal wall enclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical opening is too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bow- els or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through the abdominal wall. | No
90 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
91 | NarrativeText | There are many causes for birth defects that still remain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal wall defects is unknown, and any symptoms the mother may have to indicate that the defects are present in the fetus are nondescript. | No
92 | Title | Diagnosis | No
93 | NarrativeText | At birth, the problem is obvious, because the base of the umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in worse cases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before birth, an ultrasound examination may detect the problem. It is always necessary in children with one birth defect to look for others, because birth defects are usually multiple. | No
94 | Title | Treatment | No
95 | NarrativeText | Abdominal wall defects are effectively treated with surgical repair. Unless there are accompanying anom- alies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated. The organs are normal, just misplaced. However, if the defect is large, it may be difficult to fit all the viscera into the small abdominal cavity. | No
96 | Title | Prognosis | No
97 | NarrativeText | If there are no other defects, the prognosis after sur- gical repair of this condition is relatively good. However, | No
98 | NarrativeText | 10% of those with more severe or additional abnormali- ties die from it. The organs themselves are fully function- al; the difficulty lies in fitting them inside the abdomen. The condition is, in fact, a hernia requiring only replace- ment and strengthening of the passageway through which it occurred. After surgery, increased pressure in the stretched abdomen can compromise the function of the organs inside. | No

111 | NarrativeText | Partial birth abortion is a method of late-term abor- tion that terminates a pregnancy and results in the death and intact removal of a fetus. This procedure is most commonly referred to as intact dilatation and extraction (D & X). | No
112 | Title | Purpose | No
113 | NarrativeText | Partial birth abortion, or D&X, is performed to end a pregnancy and results in the death of a fetus, typically in the late second or third trimester. Although D&X is high- ly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advan- tages that make it a preferable procedure in some circum- stances. One perceived advantage is that the fetus is removed largely intact, allowing for better evaluation and autopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies. Intact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower risk of puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix. Another perceived advantage is that D&X ends the pregnancy without requiring the woman to go through labor, which may be less emotionally traumatic than other methods of late-term abortion. In addition, D&X may offer a lower cost and shorter procedure time. | No
114 | Title | Precautions | No
115 | NarrativeText | Women considering D&X should be aware of the highly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro- versy common to all late-term abortions is whether the fetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’s body. A specific area of controversy with D&X is that fetal death does not occur until after most of the fetal body has exited the uterus. Several states have taken legal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicians who perform abortions do not perform D&X. This may restrict the availability of this procedure to women seek- ing late-term abortion. | No
116 | Title | Description | No
117 | NarrativeText | Intact D&X, or partial birth abortion first involves administration of medications to cause the cervix to dilate, usually over the course of several days. Next, the physician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position. The body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feet first, until only the head remains inside the uterus. Then, the physician uses an instrument to puncture the base of the skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, the contents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out, which results in the death of the fetus, and reduces the sizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass through the cervix. The dead and otherwise intact fetus is then removed from the woman’s body. | No
118 | Title | Preparation | No
119 | NarrativeText | Medical preparation for D&X involves an outpatient visit to administer medications, such as /aminaria, to cause the cervix to begin dilating. | No
120 | NarrativeText | In addition, preparation may involve fulfilling local legal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting period, counseling, or an informed consent procedure reviewing stages of fetal development, childbirth, alternative abor- tion methods, and adoption. | No

127 | Title | Risks | No
128 | NarrativeText | With all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion is performed, the more complicated the procedure and the greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition to associated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk of injury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, blood clots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection, and anesthesia-related complications. There is also a risk of incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is not dead when removed from the woman’s body. Possible long-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant or carrying a future pregnancy to term. | No
129 | Title | Normal results | No

147 | NarrativeText | However, selective reduction is recommended often in cases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence of more than one fetus, typically, at least three or more fetuses. In the general population, multi-fetal pregnancy happens in only about 1-2% of pregnant women. But multi-fetal pregnan- cies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs. | No
148 | Title | Precautions | No
149 | NarrativeText | Because women or couples who use fertility drugs have made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is possi- ble that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfort- able with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multi- fetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in fertility treat- ment should be made aware of the risk of multi-fetal pregnancy and consider the prospect of recommended reduction before undergoing fertility treatment. | No
150 | Title | Description | No
151 | NarrativeText | Selective reduction is usually performed between nine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successful when performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple proce- dure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. A nee- dle is inserted into the woman’s stomach or vagina and potassium chloride is injected into the fetus. | No
152 | Title | Preparation | No
153 | NarrativeText | Individuals who have chosen selective reduction to safeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseled prior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor- mation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy to both the fetuses and the mother compared with the risks after the reduction. | No
154 | NarrativeText | Individuals seeking an abortion for any reason should consider the ethical implications whether it be because the fetus is not the preferred sex or because the fetus would be born with a severe birth defect. | No
155 | Title | Aftercare | No
156 | NarrativeText | Counseling should continue after the abortion because it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feel guilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mental health professionals should be consulted throughout the process. | No
157 | Title | Risks | No
158 | NarrativeText | About 75% of women who undergo selective reduc- tion will go into premature labor. About 4-5% of women undergoing selective reduction also miscarry one or more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associated with multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher. | No
159 | Title | Normal results | No
160 | NarrativeText | In cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three or more fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typically develop as they would as if they were conceived as twins. | No

175 | Title | Definition | No
176 | NarrativeText | Therapeutic abortion is the intentional termination of a pregnancy before the fetus can live independently. Abortion has been a legal procedure in the United States since 1973. | No
177 | Title | Purpose | No
178 | NarrativeText | An abortion may be performed whenever there is some compelling reason to end a pregnancy. Women have abortions because continuing the pregnancy would cause them hardship, endanger their life or health, or because prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will be born with severe abnormalities. | No
179 | NarrativeText | Abortions are safest when performed within the first six to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period. The cal- culation of this date is referred to as the gestational age and is used in determining the stage of pregnancy. For example, a woman who is two weeks late having her period is said to be six weeks pregnant, because it is six weeks since she last menstruated. | No
180 | NarrativeText | About 90% of women who have abortions do so before 13 weeks and experience few complications. Abortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a higher rate of complications. Abortions after 24 weeks are extremely rare and are usually limited to situations where the life of the mother is in danger. | No
181 | Title | Precautions | No
182 | NarrativeText | Most women are able to have abortions at clinics or outpatient facilities if the procedure is performed early in pregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes, controlled epilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or who are HIV positive can often have abortions as outpatients if precautions are taken. Women with heart disease, pre- vious endocarditis, asthma, lupus erythematosus, uter- ine fibroid tumors, blood clotting disorders, poorly con- trolled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usually need to be hospitalized in order to receive special moni- toring and medications during the procedure. | No
183 | Title | Description | No
184 | Title | Very early abortions | No
185 | NarrativeText | Between five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be ended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. This procedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation, mini-suction, or preemptive abortion. The contents of the uterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastic tube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. Suction is applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump. | No
186 | NarrativeText | Another method is called the “morning after” pill, or emergency contraception. Basically, it involves taking high doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48 hours of having unprotected sex. The high doses of hormones causes the uterine lining to change so that it will not sup- port a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been fertilized, it is simply expelled from the body. | No
187 | NarrativeText | There are two types of emergency contraception. One type is identical to ordinary birth control pills, and uses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This type is available with a prescription under the brand name Pre- ven. But women can even use their regular birth control pills for emergency contraception, after they check with their doctor about the proper dose. About half of women who use birth control pills for emergency contraception get nauseated and 20 percent vomit. This method cuts the risk of pregnancy 75 percent. | No
188 | NarrativeText | The other type of morning-after pill contains only one hormone: progestin, and is available under the brand name Plan B. It is more effective than the first type with a lower risk of nausea and vomiting. It reduces the risk of pregnancy 89 percent. | No
189 | NarrativeText | Women should check with their physicians regard- ing the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends on the Vulsellum Vagina Uterus Speculum Extraction tube Cervix | No
190 | NarrativeText | Between 5 and 7 weeks, a pregnancy can be ended by a pro- cedure called menstrual extraction. The contents of the uterus are suctioned out through a thin extraction tube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. (//lustration by Elec- tronic Illustrators Group.) | No
191 | NarrativeText | brand of birth control pill. Not all birth control pills will work for emergency contraception. | No
192 | NarrativeText | Menstrual extractions are safe, but because the amount of fetal material is so small at this stage of devel- opment, it is easy to miss. This results in an incomplete abortion that means the pregnancy continues. | No
193 | Title | First trimester abortions | No
194 | NarrativeText | The first trimester of pregnancy includes the first 13 weeks after the last menstrual period. In the United States, about 90% of abortions are performed during this period. It is the safest time in which to have an abortion, and the time in which women have the most choice of how the procedure is performed. | No
195 | NarrativeText | MEDICAL ABORTIONS. Medical abortions are brought about by taking medications that end the pregnancy. The advantages of a first trimester medical abortion are: ¢ The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instruments are used. | No
196 | ListItem | ¢ Anesthesia is not required. | No
197 | ListItem | ¢ Drugs are administered either orally or by injection. | No
198 | ListItem | « The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage. | No
199 | NarrativeText | Disadvantages of a medical abortion are: + The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week. | No

201 | ListItem | ¢ The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor. | No
202 | ListItem | * Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur- gical abortion. | No
203 | ListItem | * The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is expelled. | No
204 | NarrativeText | Two different medications can be used to bring about an abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop- ping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die. | No
205 | NarrativeText | On the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives an injection of methotrexate. On the second visit, about a week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), an oxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible for various hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction (prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of the uterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel the contents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow- up visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that the abortion is complete. | No
206 | NarrativeText | With this procedure, a woman will feel cramping and may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This combination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending pregnancy. | No
207 | NarrativeText | Mifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand name Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog- esterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue, then stimulates uterine contractions thus ending the pregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after the first day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit to the doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two days later she returns and, if the miscarriage has not occurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes the uterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need to take misoprostol. After an observation period, she returns home. | No
208 | NarrativeText | Within four days, 90% of women have expelled the contents of their uterus and completed the abortion. Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed the abortion. A third follow-up visit to the doctor is neces- sary to confirm through observation or ultrasound that the procedure is complete. In the event that it is not, a surgical abortion is performed. Studies show that 4.5 to 8 percent of women need surgery or a blood transfusion after taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists in about | percent of women. In this case, surgical abortion is recommended because the fetus may be damanged. Side effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavy cramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a nor- mal period and may last up to 16 days. | No
209 | NarrativeText | Mifepristone is not recommended for women with ectopic pregnancy, an IUD, who have been taking long- term steroidal therapy, have bleeding abnormalities or on blood-thinners such as Coumadin. | No
210 | Title | Surgical abortions | No
211 | NarrativeText | First trimester surgical abortions are performed using vacuum aspiration. The procedure is also called dilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation, vacu- um curettage, or suction curettage. | No
212 | NarrativeText | Advantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are: + It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure. | No
213 | ListItem | ¢ The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes. | No
214 | ListItem | ¢ Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less. | No
215 | ListItem | The woman does not see the products of her womb being removed. | No
216 | NarrativeText | Disadvantages include: ¢ The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are used. | No
217 | ListItem | ¢ Infection may occur. | No
218 | NarrativeText | During a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix is gradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into the cervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a suc- tion pump is inserted through the cervix and the con- tents of the uterus are suctioned out. The procedure is 97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a woman feels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is often given to numb the cervix, but it does not mask uterine cramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman may return home. | No
219 | Title | Second trimester abortions | No
220 | NarrativeText | Although it is better to have an abortion during the first trimester, some second trimester abortions may be inevitable. The results of genetic testing are often not available until 16 weeks. In addition, women, especially teens, may not have recognized the pregnancy or come to terms with it emotionally soon enough to have a first trimester abortion. Teens make up the largest group hav- ing second trimester abortions. | No
221 | NarrativeText | Some second trimester abortions are performed as a D & E. The procedures are similar to those used in the first trimester, but a larger suction tube must be used because more material must be removed. This increases the amount of cervical dilation necessary and increases the risk of the procedure. Many physicians are reluctant to perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and for some women is it not a medically safe option. | No
222 | NarrativeText | The alternative to a D & E in the second trimester is an abortion by induced labor. Induced labor may require an overnight stay in a hospital. The day before the proce- dure, the woman visits the doctor for tests, and to either | No

225 | NarrativeText | Fibroid tumors—Fibroid tumors are non-cancer- ous (benign) growths in the uterus. They occur in 30-40% of women over age 40, and do not need to be removed unless they are causing symptoms that interfere with a woman’s normal activities. | No
226 | NarrativeText | Lupus erythematosus—A chronic inflammatory disease in which inappropriate immune system reactions cause abnormalities in the blood vessels and connective tissue. | No

228 | NarrativeText | Rh negative—Lacking the Rh factor, genetically determined antigens in red blood cells that pro- duce immune responses. If an Rh negative woman is pregnant with an Rh positive fetus, her body will produce antibodies against the fetus’s blood, caus- ing a disease known as Rh disease. Sensitization to the disease occurs when the women’s blood is exposed to the fetus’s blood. Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) is a vaccine that must be given to a woman after an abortion, miscarriage, or prenatal tests in order to prevent sensitization to Rh disease. | No
229 | NarrativeText | have rods inserted in her cervix to help dilate it or to receive medication that will soften the cervix and speed up labor. | No
230 | NarrativeText | On the day of the abortion, drugs, usually prosta- glandins to induce contractions, and a salt water solution, are injected into the uterus. Contractions begin, and with- in eight to 72 hours the woman delivers the fetus. | No
231 | NarrativeText | Side effects of this procedure include nausea, vomit- ing, and diarrhea from the prostaglandins, and pain from uterine cramps. Anesthesia of the sort used in childbirth can be given to mask the pain. Many women are able to go home a few hours after the procedure. | No
232 | NarrativeText | Very early abortions cost between $200-$400. Later abortions cost more. The cost increases about $100 per week between the thirteenth and sixteenth week. Second trimester abortions are much more costly because they often involve more risk, more services, anesthesia, and sometimes a hospital stay. Insurance carriers and HMOs may or may not cover the procedure. Federal law pro- hibits federal funds including Medicaid funds, from being used to pay for an elective abortion. | No
233 | Title | Preparation | No
234 | NarrativeText | The doctor must know accurately the stage of a woman’s pregnancy before an abortion is performed. The doctor will ask the woman questions about her menstrual cycle and also do a physical examination to confirm the stage of pregnancy. This may be done at an office visit before the abortion or on the day of the abortion. Some states require a waiting period before an abortion can be performed. Others require parental or court consent for a child under age 18 to receive an abortion. | No
235 | NarrativeText | Despite the fact that almost half of all women in the United States have had at least one abortion by the time they reach age 45, abortion is surrounded by controversy. Women often find themselves in emotional turmoil when deciding if an abortion is a procedure they wish to under- go. Pre-abortion counseling is important in helping a woman resolve any questions she may have about having the procedure. | No
236 | Title | Aftercare | No
237 | NarrativeText | Regardless of the method used to perform the abor- tion, a woman will be observed for a period of time to make sure her blood pressure is stable and that bleeding is controlled. The doctor may prescribe antibiotics to reduce the chance of infection. Women who are Rh nega- tive (lacking genetically determined antigens in their red blood cells that produce immune responses) should be given a human Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) after the procedure unless the father of the fetus is also Rh nega- tive. This prevents blood incompatibility complications in future pregnancies. | No
238 | NarrativeText | Bleeding will continue for about five days in a surgical abortion and longer in a medical abortion. To decrease the risk of infection, a woman should avoid intercourse and not use tampons and douches for two weeks after the abortion. | No
239 | NarrativeText | A follow-up visit is a necessary part of the woman’s aftercare. Contraception will be offered to women who wish to avoid future pregnancies, because menstrual periods normally resume within a few weeks. | No
240 | Title | Risks | No
241 | NarrativeText | Serious complications resulting from abortions per- formed before 13 weeks are rare. Of the 90% of women who have abortions in this time period, 2.5% have minor complications that can be handled without hospitaliza- tion. Less than 0.5% have complications that require a hospital stay. The rate of complications increases as the pregnancy progresses. | No

263 | NarrativeText | An abscess is an enclosed collection of liquefied tis- sue, known as pus, somewhere in the body. It is the result of the body’s defensive reaction to foreign material. | No
264 | Title | Description | No
265 | NarrativeText | There are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile. Most abscesses are septic, which means that they are the result of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur any- where in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immune response are required. In response to the invading germ, white blood cells gather at the infected site and begin producing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germ by digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing the germs and breaking them down into small pieces that can be picked up by the circulation and eliminated from the body. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest body tissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi- cals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain- ing digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells, and enzymes. | No
266 | NarrativeText | An abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that begins with a process called inflammation. Initially, as the invading germ activates the body’s immune system, several events occur: * Blood flow to the area increases. | No
267 | ListItem | The temperature of the area increases due to the increased blood supply. | No
268 | ListItem | ¢ The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood, and other liquids. | No
269 | ListItem | ¢ It turns red. | No
270 | ListItem | + It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling and the chemical activity. | No
271 | NarrativeText | These four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain— characterize inflammation. | No
272 | NarrativeText | As the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn to liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of an abscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefies more and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol- lows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easily digested. A good example is an abscess just beneath the skin. It most easily continues along beneath the skin rather than working its way through the skin where it could drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscess also leak into the general circulation and produce symp- toms just like any other infection. These include chills, fever, aching, and general discomfort. | No
273 | NarrativeText | Sterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the same process caused not by germs but by non-living irri- tants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin is not absorbed, it stays where it was injected and may cause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess— sterile because there is no infection involved. Sterile abscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps as they scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus. | No
274 | FigureCaption | An amoebic abscess caused by Entameoba histolytica. (Phototake NYC. Reproduced by permission.) | No
275 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
276 | NarrativeText | Many different agents cause abscesses. The most common are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the cause of abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near the large bowel, particularly around the anus, may be caused by any of the numerous bacteria found within the large bowel. Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be caused by any organism that can travel there through the circula- tion. Bacteria, amoeba, and certain fungi can travel in this fashion. Abscesses in other parts of the body are caused by organisms that normally inhabit nearby struc- tures or that infect them. Some common causes of specif- ic abscesses are: « skin abscesses by normal skin flora ¢ dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora | No
277 | ListItem | «lung abscesses by normal airway flora, pneumonia germs, or tuberculosis * abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel flora | No
278 | Title | Specific types of abscesses | No
279 | NarrativeText | Listed below are some of the more common and important abscesses. | No
280 | ListItem | * Carbuncles and other boils. Skin oil glands (sebaceous glands) on the back or the back of the neck are the ones usually infected. The most common germ involved is Staphylococcus aureus. Acne is a similar condition of sebaceous glands on the face and back. | No
281 | ListItem | + Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect a tiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal bac- teria can enter this opening, causing an infection and subsequent abscess. | No

289 | NarrativeText | Sinus—A tubular channel connecting one body part with another or with the outside. | No
290 | ListItem | ¢ Retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, peritonsillar abscess. As a result of throat infections like strep throat and tonsillitis, bacteria can invade the deeper tissues of the throat and cause an abscess. These abscesses can com- promise swallowing and even breathing. | No
291 | ListItem | ¢ Lung abscess. During or after pneumonia, whether it’s due to bacteria [common pneumonia], tuberculosis, fungi, parasites, or other germs, abscesses can develop as a complication. | No
292 | ListItem | + Liver abscess. Bacteria or amoeba from the intestines can spread through the blood to the liver and cause abscesses. | No
293 | ListItem | * Psoas abscess. Deep in the back of the abdomen on either side of the lumbar spine lie the psoas muscles. They flex the hips. An abscess can develop in one of these muscles, usually when it spreads from the appen- dix, the large bowel, or the fallopian tubes. | No
294 | Title | Diagnosis | No
295 | NarrativeText | The common findings of inflammation—heat, red- ness, swelling, and pain—easily identify superficial abscesses. Abscesses in other places may produce only generalized symptoms such as fever and discomfort. If the patient’s symptoms and physical examination do not help, a physician may have to resort to a battery of tests to | No
296 | Title | 14 | No
297 | NarrativeText | locate the site of an abscess, but usually something in the initial evaluation directs the search. Recent or chronic dis- ease in an organ suggests it may be the site of an abscess. Dysfunction of an organ or system—for instance, seizures or altered bowel function—may provide the clue. Pain and tenderness on physical examination are common findings. Sometimes a deep abscess will eat a small chan- nel (sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus. A sterile abscess may cause only a painful lump deep in the but- tock where a shot was given. | No
298 | Title | Treatment | No
299 | NarrativeText | Since skin is very resistant to the spread of infection, it acts as a barrier, often keeping the toxic chemicals of an abscess from escaping the body on their own. Thus, the pus must be drained from the abscess by a physician. The surgeon determines when the abscess is ready for drainage and opens a path to the outside, allowing the pus to escape. Ordinarily, the body handles the remaining infection, sometimes with the help of antibiotics or other drugs. The surgeon may leave a drain (a piece of cloth or rubber) in the abscess cavity to prevent it from closing before all the pus has drained out. | No
300 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
301 | NarrativeText | If an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be slowly working its way through the skin as it is more rapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicals work faster at higher temperatures, applications of hot compresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten the digestion of the skin and eventually result in its breaking down, releasing the pus spontaneously. This treatment is best reserved for smaller abscesses in relatively less dan- gerous areas of the body—limbs, trunk, back of the neck. It is also useful for all superficial abscesses in their very early stages. It will “ripen” them. | No
302 | NarrativeText | Contrast hydrotherapy, alternating hot and cold compresses, can also help assist the body in resorption of the abscess. There are two homeopathic remedies that work to rebalance the body in relation to abscess forma- tion, Silica and Hepar sulphuris. In cases of septic abscesses, bentonite clay packs (bentonite clay and a small amount of Hydrastis powder) can be used to draw the infection from the area. | No
303 | Title | Prognosis | No
304 | NarrativeText | Once the abscess is properly drained, the prognosis is excellent for the condition itself. The reason for the abscess (other diseases the patient has) will determine the overall outcome. If, on the other hand, the abscess ruptures into neighboring areas or permits the infectious agent to spill into the bloodstream, serious or fatal conse- quences are likely. Abscesses in and around the nasal sinuses, face, ears, and scalp may work their way into the brain. Abscesses within an abdominal organ such as the liver may rupture into the abdominal cavity. In either case, the result is life threatening. Blood poisoning is a term commonly used to describe an infection that has spilled into the blood stream and spread throughout the body from a localized origin. Blood poisoning, known to physicians as septicemia, is also life threatening. | No
305 | NarrativeText | Of special note, abscesses in the hand are more seri- ous than they might appear. Due to the intricate structure and the overriding importance of the hand, any hand infection must be treated promptly and competently. | No
306 | Title | Prevention | No
307 | NarrativeText | Infections that are treated early with heat (if superfi- cial) or antibiotics will often resolve without the forma- tion of an abscess. It is even better to avoid infections altogether by taking prompt care of open injuries, partic- ularly puncture wounds.

However, they may develop in any organ, and are commonly found in the breast and gums. Abscesses are far more serious and call for more specific treatment if they are located in deep organs such as the lung, liver or brain. | No
320 | NarrativeText | Because the lining of the abscess cavity tends to interfere with the amount of the drug that can penetrate the source of infection from the blood, the cavity itself may require draining. Once an abscess has fully formed, it often does not respond to antibiotics. Even if the antibiotic does penetrate into the abscess, it doesn’t func- tion as well in that environment. | No
321 | Title | Precautions | No
322 | NarrativeText | An abscess can usually be diagnosed visually, al- though an imaging technique such as a computed tomog- raphy scan may be used to confirm the extent of the abscess before drainage.

326 | NarrativeText | A doctor will cut into the lining of the abscess, allow- ing the pus to escape either through a drainage tube or by leaving the cavity open to the skin. How big the incision is depends on how quickly the pus is encountered. | No
327 | NarrativeText | Once the abscess is opened, the doctor will clean and irrigate the wound thoroughly with saline. If it is not too large or deep, the doctor may simply pack the abscess wound with gauze for 24-48 hours to absorb the pus and discharge. | No
328 | NarrativeText | If it is a deeper abscess, the doctor may insert a drainage tube after cleaning out the wound. Once the tube is in place, the surgeon closes the incision with simple stitch- es, and applies a sterile dressing. Drainage is maintained for several days to help prevent the abscess from reforming. | No

346 | NarrativeText | Abuse is defined as any thing that is harmful, injuri- ous, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive and wrongful misuse of anything. There are several major types of abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a child or an adult, substance abuse, elderly abuse, and emotional abuse. | No
347 | Title | Description | No
348 | NarrativeText | Physical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury by an other person. The injuries can include punching, kick- ing, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair. The physical abuse inflicted on a child can result in bruises, burns, poisoning, broken bones, and internal hemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarily occurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio- lence. It is estimated that approximately three million children witness domestic violence every year. | No
349 | NarrativeText | Sexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior between an adult and child or between two children, one of whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexual behaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but- tocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can also include exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra- tion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects. | No
350 | NarrativeText | Pornographic photography is also used in sexual abuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97% male. Females are more often perpetrators in child-care settings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by a female with normal hygiene care. Sexual abuse by step- fathers is five times more common than with biological fathers. Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or fathers is the most common form of incest. | No
351 | NarrativeText | Sexual abuse can also take the form of rape. The legal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene- tration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec- tion and ejaculation are not necessary. Rape is the perpe- tration of an act of sexual intercourse whether: + will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by use of drugs). | No
352 | ListItem | * mental impairment renders the victim incapable of rational judgment. | No
353 | ListItem | + if the victim is below the legal age established for con- sent. | No
354 | NarrativeText | Substance abuse is an abnormal pattern of substance usage leading to significant distress or impairment. The criteria include one or more of the following occurring within a 12-month period: * recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill obligations at home, work, or school. | No
355 | ListItem | * using substance in situations that are physically danger- ous (i.e., while driving). | No
356 | ListItem | * recurrent substance-related legal problems. | No
357 | ListItem | * continued usage despite recurrent social and interper- sonal problems (i.e., arguments and fights with signifi- cant other). | No
358 | NarrativeText | Abuse in the elderly is common and occurs mostly as a result of caretaker burnout, due to the high level of dependency frail, elderly patients usually require. Abuse can be manifested by physical signs, fear, and delaying or not reporting the need for advanced medical care. Elderly patients may also exhibit financial abuse (money or possessions taken away) and abandonment. | No
359 | NarrativeText | Emotional abuse generally continues even after phys- ical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a personally tailored form of verbal or gesture abuse expressed to illic- it a provoked response. | No
360 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
361 | NarrativeText | Children who have been abused usually have a variety of symptoms that encompass behavioral, emotional, and psychosomatic problems. Children who have been physi- cally abused tend to be more aggressive, angry, hostile, depressed, and have low self-esteem. Additionally, they exhibit fear, anxiety, and nightmares. Severe psychological problems may result in suicidal behavior or posttraumatic stress disorder. Physically abused children may complain of physical illness even in the absence of a cause. They may also suffer from eating disorders and encopresis. Chil- dren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexual behavior in the form of aggressiveness and hyperarousal. Adolescents may display promiscuity, sexual acting out, and—in some situations—homosexual contact. | No
362 | NarrativeText | Physical abuse directed towards adults can ultimately lead to death. Approximately 50% of women murdered in the United States were killed by a former or current male partner. Approximately one-third of emergency room consultations by women were prompted due to domestic violence. Female victims who are married also have a higher rate of internal injuries and unconscious- KEY TERMS Encopresis—Abnormalities relating to bowel move- ments that can occur as a result of stress or fear. | No
363 | NarrativeText | ness than victims of stranger assault (mugging, robbery). Physical abuse or rape can also occur between married persons and persons of the same gender. Perpetrators usu- ally sexually assault their victims to dominate, hurt, and debase them. It is common for physical and sexual vio- lence to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sex- ually assaulted persons were also physically abused in the form of punching, beating, or threatening the victim with a weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually males who are hurt and humiliated tend to physical assault persons whom they are intimately involved with, such as spouses and/or children. Males who assault a female tend to have experienced or witnessed violence during childhood. They also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive, and are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directed against children. Jealous males tend to monitor the women’s movements and whereabouts and to isolate other sources of protection and support. They interpret their behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resent- ment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of los- ing control. Males may also use aggression against females in an effort to control and intimidate partners. | No
364 | NarrativeText | Abuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail, elderly community. The caretaker is usually the perpetrator. Care- taker abuse can be suspected if there is evidence suggest- ing behavioral changes in the elderly person when the caretaker is present. Additionally, elderly abuse can be possible if there are delays between injuries and treatment, inconsistencies between injury and explanations, lack of hygiene or clothing, and prescriptions no being filled. | No
365 | Title | Diagnosis | No
366 | NarrativeText | Children who are victims of domestic violence are frequently injured attempting to protect their mother from an abusive partner. Injuries are visible by inspection or self-report. Physical abuse of an adult may be also be evident by inspection with visible cuts and/or bruises or self report. | No
367 | NarrativeText | Sexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be diagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can be assessed for ejaculatory evidence from the perpetrator. Ejaculatory specimens can be retrieved from the mouth, rectum, and clothing. Tests for sexually transmitted dis- eases may be performed. | No
368 | NarrativeText | Elderly abuse can be suspected if the elderly patient demonstrates a fear from the caretaker. Additionally, elderly abuse can be suspected if there are signs indicat- ing intentional delay of required medical care or a change in medical status. | No
369 | NarrativeText | Substance abuse can be suspected in a person who continues to indulge in their drug of choice despite recur- rent negative consequences. The diagnosis can be made after administration of a comprehensive bio-psycho- social exam and standardized chemical abuse assess- ments by a therapist. | No
370 | Title | Treatment | No
371 | NarrativeText | Children who are victims of physical or sexual abuse typically require psychological support and medical atten- tion. A complaint may be filed with the local family social services that will initiate investigations. The authorities will usually follow up the allegation or offense. Children may also be referred for psychological evaluation and/or treatment. The victim may be placed in foster care pending the investigation outcome. The police may also investigate physical and sexual abuse of an adult. The victim may require immediate medical care and long-term psychologi- cal treatment. It is common for children to be adversely affected by domestic violence situations and the local fam- ily services agency may be involved. | No
372 | NarrativeText | Substance abusers should elect treatment, either inpa- tient or outpatient, depending on severity of addiction. Long term treatment and/or medications may be utilized to assist in abstinence. The patient should be encouraged to participate in community centered support groups. | No
373 | Title | Prognosis | No
374 | NarrativeText | The prognosis depends on the diagnosis. Usually victims of physical and sexual abuse require therapy to deal with emotional distress associated with the incident. Perpetrators require further psychological evaluation and treatment. Victims of abuse may have a variety of emo- tional problems including depression, acts of suicide, or anxiety. Children of sexual abuse may as adults enter abusive relationships or have problems with intimacy. The substance abuser may experience relapses, since the cardinal feature of all addictive disorders is a tendency to return to symptoms. Elderly patients may suffer from further medical problems and/or anxiety, and in some cases neglect may precipitate death. | No
375 | Title | Prevention | No
376 | NarrativeText | Prevention programs are geared to education and awareness. Detection of initial symptoms or characteris- tic behaviors may assist in some situations. In some cases treatment may be sought before incident. The pro- fessional treating the abused persons must develop a clear sense of the relationship dynamics and the chances for continued harm. | No

395 | Title | Purpose | No
396 | NarrativeText | Acetaminophen is used to relieve many kinds of minor aches and pains—headaches, muscle aches, back- aches, toothaches, menstrual cramps, arthritis, and the aches and pains that often accompany colds. | No
397 | Title | Description | No
398 | NarrativeText | This drug is available without a prescription. Aceta- minophen—or APAP—is sold under various brand names, including Tylenol, Panadol, Aspirin Free Anacin, and Bayer Select Maximum Strength Headache Pain Relief Formula. Many multi-symptom cold, flu, and sinus medicines also contain acetaminophen. Check the ingredients listed on the container to see if aceta- minophen is included in the product. | No
399 | NarrativeText | Studies have shown that acetaminophen relieves pain and reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But differences between these two common drugs exist. Acetaminophen is less likely than aspirin to irritate the stomach. However, unlike aspirin, acetaminophen does not reduce the red- ness, stiffness, or swelling that accompany arthritis. | No
400 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
401 | NarrativeText | The usual dosage for adults and children age 12 and over is 325-650 mg every 4- 6 hours as needed. No more than 4 grams (4000 mg) should be taken in 24 hours. Because the drug can potentially harm the liver, people who drink alcohol in large quantities should take consid- erably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid the drug completely. | No
402 | NarrativeText | For children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150- 300 mg, three to four times a day. Check with a physician for dosages for children under age 6 years. | No
403 | Title | Precautions | No
404 | NarrativeText | Never take more than the recommended dosage of acetaminophen unless told to do so by a physician or dentist. | No
405 | NarrativeText | Patients should not use acetaminophen for more than 10 days to relieve pain (5 days for children) or for more than 3 days to reduce fever, unless directed to do so by a physician. If symptoms do not go away—or if they get worse—contact a physician. Anyone who drinks three or more alcoholic beverages a day should check with a physician before using this drug and should never take more than the recommended dosage. A risk of liver dam- age exists from combining large amounts of alcohol and acetaminophen. People who already have kidney or liver disease or liver infections should also consult with a physician before using the drug. So should women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. | No
406 | NarrativeText | Smoking cigarettes may interfere with the effective- ness of acetaminophen. Smokers may need to take higher doses of the medicine, but should not take more than the recommended daily dosage unless told by a physician to do so. | No

412 | NarrativeText | Acetaminophen interferes with the results of some medical tests. Before having medical tests done, check to see whether taking acetaminophen will affect the results. Avoiding the drug for a few days before the tests may be necessary. | No
413 | Title | Side effects | No
414 | NarrativeText | Acetaminophen causes few side effects. The most common one is lightheadedness. Some people may experience trembling and pain in the side or the lower back. Allergic reactions do occur in some people, but they are rare. Anyone who develops symptoms such as a rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing after taking acetaminophen should stop taking the drug and get immediate medical attention. Other rare side effects include yellow skin or eyes, unusual bleeding or bruis- ing, weakness, fatigue, bloody or black stools, bloody or cloudy urine, and a sudden decrease in the amount of urine. | No
415 | NarrativeText | Overdoses of acetaminophen may cause nausea, vomiting, sweating, and exhaustion. Very large overdoses can cause liver damage. In case of an overdose, get immediate medical attention. | No
416 | Title | nteractions | No
417 | NarrativeText | Acetaminophen may interact with a variety of other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be greater. Among the drugs that may interact with acetaminophen are alcohol, nonsteroidal anti-inflam- matory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Motrin, oral contra- ceptives, the antiseizure drug phenytoin (Dilantin), the blood-thinning drug warfarin (Coumadin), the choles- terol-lowering drug cholestyramine (Questran), the antibiotic Isoniazid, and zidovudine (Retrovir, AZT). | No

422 | NarrativeText | Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus that pre- vents normal swallowing. | No
423 | Title | Description | No
424 | NarrativeText | Achalasia affects the esophagus, the tube that carries swallowed food from the back of the throat down into the stomach. A ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance to the stomach. This sphincter muscle is normally contracted to close the esophagus. When the sphincter is closed, the contents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esopha- gus. Backward flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irri- tate and inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave of esophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis pushes food along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes the esophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stom- ach. In achalasia, which means “failure to relax,” the esophageal sphincter remains contracted. Normal peristal- sis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach. | No
425 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
426 | Title | Causes | No
427 | NarrativeText | Achalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve cells that normally signal the brain to relax the esophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this degener- ation is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infec- tion is suspected. | No
428 | Title | Symptoms | No
429 | NarrativeText | Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most com- mon symptom of achalasia. The person with achalasia usu- ally has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foods, often feeling that food “gets stuck” on the way down. The person has chest pain that is often mistaken for angina pectoris (cardiac pain). Heartburn and difficulty belching | No
430 | Title | 20 | No
431 | NarrativeText | are common. Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Other symptoms may include nighttime cough or recurrent pneumonia caused by food passing into the lower airways. | No
432 | Title | Diagnosis | No
433 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical history. The history should focus on the timing of symp- toms and on eliminating other medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Tests used to diagnose achalasia include: + Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is passed into the esophagus to measure the pressure exerted by the esophageal sphincter. | No
434 | ListItem | * X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to act as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines of the esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier to see its constriction at the sphincter. | No
435 | ListItem | * Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a light source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy is used to look directly at the surface of the esophagus. This test can also detect tumors that cause symptoms like those of achalasia. Cancer of the esophagus occurs as a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients. | No
436 | Title | Treatment | No
437 | NarrativeText | The first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon dila- tion. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane or bal- loon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter and inflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is effective in about 70% of patients. | No
438 | NarrativeText | Three other treatments are used for achalasia when balloon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable. | No
439 | ListItem | * Botulinum toxin injection. Injected into the sphincter, botulinum toxin paralyzes the muscle and allows it to relax. Symptoms usually return within one to two years. | No
440 | ListItem | + Esophagomyotomy. This surgical procedure cuts the sphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to open. Esophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with the development of techniques allowing very small abdom- inal incisions. | No
441 | ListItem | ¢ Drug therapy. Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker, reduces muscle contraction. Taken daily, this drug pro- vides relief for about two-thirds of patients for as long as two years. | No
442 | Title | Prognosis | No

464 | Title | Description | No
465 | NarrativeText | Achondroplasia is one of a number of chondodystro- phies, in which the development of cartilage, and there- fore, bone is disturbed. The disorder appears in approxi- mately one in every 10,000 births. Achondroplasia is usually diagnosed at birth, owing to the characteristic appearance of the newborn. | No
466 | NarrativeText | Normal bone growth depends on the production of cartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over time, calci- um is deposited within the cartilage, causing it to hard- en and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalities of this process prevent the bones (especially those in the limbs) from growing as long as they normally should, at the same time allowing the bones to become abnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of the body and the skull are mostly not affected, although the opening from the skull through which the spinal cord passes (foramen magnum) is often narrower than nor- mal, and the opening (spinal canal) through which the spinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomes increasingly and abnormally small down the length of the spine. | No
467 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
468 | NarrativeText | Achondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is a dominant trait, meaning that anybody with the genetic defect will display all the symptoms of the disorder. A parent with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing it | No

Interest- ingly enough, the defect seen in achondroplasia is one of only a few defects known to increase in frequency with increasing age of the father (many genetic defects are linked to increased age of the mother). | No
477 | NarrativeText | People with achondroplasia have abnormally short arms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal size, as is their head. The appearance of short limbs and normal head size actually makes the head appear to be oversized. The bridge of the nose often has a scooped out appear- ance termed “saddle nose.” The lower back has an abnor- mal curvature, or sway back. The face often displays an overly prominent forehead, and a relative lack of devel- opment of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Because the foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnormally narrowed, nerve damage may occur if the spinal cord or nerves become compressed. The narrowed foramen mag- num may disrupt the normal flow of fluid between the brain and the spinal cord, resulting in the accumulation of too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Children with achondroplasia have a very high risk of serious and repeated middle ear infections, which can result in hear- ing loss. The disease does not affect either mental capac- ity, or reproductive ability. | No

A number of measurements of the bones in x-ray images will reveal abnormal proportions. | No
481 | Title | Treatment | No
482 | NarrativeText | No treatment will reverse the defect present in achon- droplasia. All patients with the disease will be short, with abnormally proportioned limbs, trunk, and head. Treat- ment of achondroplasia primarily addresses some of the complications of the disorder, including problems due to nerve compression, hydrocephalus, bowed legs, and abnormal curves in the spine. Children with achondropla- sia who develop middle ear infections (acute otitis media) will require quick treatment with antibiotics and careful monitoring in order to avoid hearing loss. | No
483 | Title | Prognosis | No
484 | NarrativeText | Achondroplasia is a disease which causes consider- able deformity. However, with careful attention paid to the development of dangerous complications (nerve compression, hydrocephalus), most people are in good health, and can live a normal lifespan. | No

497 | NarrativeText | Acid phosphatase is an enzyme found throughout the body, but primarily in the prostate gland. Like all enzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reac- tions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnose whether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness of treatment. The test has been largely supplanted by the prostate specific antigen test (PSA). | No
498 | Title | Purpose | No
499 | NarrativeText | The male prostate gland has 100 times more acid phosphatase than any other body tissue. When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, acid phos- phatase levels rise, particularly if the cancer spreads to the bone. One-half to three-fourths of persons who have metastasized prostate cancer have high acid phosphatase levels. Levels fall after the tumor is removed or reduced through treatment. | No
500 | NarrativeText | Tissues other than prostate have small amounts of acid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen, kidney, and red blood cells and platelets. Damage to these tissues causes a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels. | No
501 | NarrativeText | Acid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen. Rape investigations will often include testing for the presence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid. | No
502 | Title | Precautions | No
503 | NarrativeText | This is not a screening test for prostate cancer. Acid phosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer has metastasized. | No
504 | Title | Description | No
505 | NarrativeText | Laboratory testing measures the amount of acid phosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine from what tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it is important to know if the increased acid phosphatase is from the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatase from the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), is the most medically significant type of acid phosphatase. | No

510 | NarrativeText | Subtle differences between prostatic acid phos- phatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues cause them to react differently in the laboratory when mixed with certain chemicals. For example, adding the chemi- cal tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of pro- static acid phosphatase but not red blood cell acid phos- phatase. Laboratory test methods based on these differ- ences reveal how much of a person’s total acid phos- phatase is derived from the prostate. Results are usually available the next day. | No

529 | NarrativeText | Acne is a common skin disease characterized by pimples on the face, chest, and back. It occurs when the pores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. | No
530 | Title | Description | No
531 | NarrativeText | Acne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne, is the most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17 million people in the United States. While acne can arise at any age, it usually begins at puberty and worsens during ado- lescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some time between the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of women develop mild acne. It is also found in some newborns. | No
532 | NarrativeText | The sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s sur- face. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s natural moisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles within which they are found are called sebaceous follicles. These follicles open onto the skin through pores. At puberty, increased levels of androgens (male hormones) cause the glands to produce too much sebum. When excess sebum combines with dead, sticky skin cells, a hard plug, or comedo, forms that blocks the pore. Mild noninflammatory acne consists of the two types of come- dones, whiteheads and blackheads. | No

Inflamed pimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; when deeper, they are called pustules. The most severe type of acne consists of cysts (closed sacs) and nodules (hard swellings). Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laid down to replace damaged cells. | No
536 | NarrativeText | The most common sites of acne are the face, chest, shoulders, and back since these are the parts of the body where the most sebaceous follicles are found. | No
537 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
538 | NarrativeText | The exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk factors have been identified: + Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience, teenagers are more likely to develop acne. | No

545 | ListItem | * Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, or picking at pimples will make them worse. | No
546 | ListItem | * Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen acne. | No
547 | ListItem | ¢ Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted air, and sweating in hot weather aggravate acne. | No
548 | ListItem | « Stress. Emotional stress may contribute to acne. | No
549 | NarrativeText | Acne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamed lesions may cause pain, tenderness, itching, or swelling. The most troubling aspects of these lesions are the nega- tive cosmetic effects and potential for scarring. Some people, especially teenagers, become emotionally upset about their condition, and have problems forming rela- tionships or keeping jobs. | No
550 | Title | Diagnosis | No
551 | NarrativeText | Acne patients are often treated by family doctors. Complicated cases are referred to a dermatologist, a skin disease specialist, or an endocrinologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the body’s endocrine (hormones and glands) system. | No
552 | NarrativeText | Acne has a characteristic appearance and is not diffi- cult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete medical history, including questions about skin care, diet, factors causing flare-ups, medication use, and prior treatment. Physical examination includes the face, upper neck, chest, shoulders, back, and other affected areas. Under good lighting, the doctor determines what types and how many blemishes are present, whether they are inflamed, whether they are deep or superficial, and whether there is scarring or skin discoloration. | No
553 | NarrativeText | In teenagers, acne is often found on the forehead, nose, and chin. As people get older, acne tends to appear towards the outer part of the face. Adult women may have acne on their chins and around their mouths. The elderly may develop whiteheads and blackheads on the upper cheeks and skin around the eyes. | No
554 | NarrativeText | Laboratory tests are not done unless the patient appears to have a hormonal disorder or other medical problem. In this case, blood analyses or other tests may be ordered. Most insurance plans cover the costs of diag- nosing and treating acne. | No
555 | Title | Treatment | No
556 | NarrativeText | Acne treatment consists of reducing sebum produc- tion, removing dead skin cells, and killing bacteria with topical drugs and oral medications. Treatment choice depends upon whether the acne is mild, moderate, or severe. | No
557 | Title | Drugs | No
558 | NarrativeText | TOPICAL DRUGS. Treatment for mild noninflamma- tory acne consists of reducing the formation of new comedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, ada- palene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially effective because it increases turnover (death and replacement) of skin cells. When complicated by inflammation, topical antibiotics may be added to the treatment regimen. Improvement is usually seen in two to four weeks. | No
559 | NarrativeText | Topical medications are available as cream, gel, lotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths. They include antibiotics (agents that kill bacteria), such as ery- thromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and meclocycline (Meclan); comedolytics (agents that loosen hard plugs and open pores) such as the vitamin A acid tretinoin (Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene (Differin), resorci- nol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as both comedolytics and antibiotics, such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid (Azelex), or benzoyl! peroxide plus erythromycin (Benza- Acne vulgaris affecting a woman’s face.

561 | NarrativeText | After washing with mild soap, the drugs are applied alone or in combination, once or twice a day over the entire affected area of skin. Possible side effects include mild redness, peeling, irritation, dryness, and an increased sensitivity to sunlight that requires use of a sunscreen. | No
562 | NarrativeText | ORAL DRUGS. Oral antibiotics are taken daily for two to four months. The drugs used include tetracycline, erythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline, clin- damycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra). Possible side effects include allergic reactions, stomach upset, vaginal yeast infections, dizzi- ness, and tooth discoloration. | No

577 | NarrativeText | A drug reserved for the treatment of severe acne, oral isotretinoin (Accutane), reduces sebum production and cell stickiness. It is the treatment of choice for severe acne with cysts and nodules, and is used with or without topical or oral antibiotics. Taken for four to five months, it pro- vides long-term disease control in up to 60% of patients. If the acne reappears, another course of isotretinoin may be needed by about 20% of patients, while another 20% may do well with topical drugs or oral antibiotics. Side effects include temporary worsening of the acne, dry skin, nose- bleeds, vision disorders, and elevated liver enzymes, blood fats and cholesterol. This drug must not be taken during pregnancy since it causes birth defects. | No

590 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments for acne focus on proper cleansing to keep the skin oil-free; eating a well-bal- anced diet high in fiber, zinc, and raw foods; and avoid- ing alcohol, dairy products, smoking, caffeine, sugar,processed foods, and foods high in iodine, such as salt. Supplementation with herbs such as burdock root (Arctium lappa), red clover (Trifolium pratense), and milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and with nutrients such as essential fatty acids, vitamin B complex, zinc, vitamin A, and chromium is also recommended. Chinese herbal remedies used for acne include cnidium seed (Cnidium monnieri) and honeysuckle flower (Lonicera japonica). Wholistic physicians or nutritionists can recommend the proper amounts of these herbs. | No

619 | NarrativeText | An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor involving cells of the myelin sheath that surrounds the vestibulo- cochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve). | No
620 | Title | Description | No
621 | NarrativeText | The vestibulocochlear nerve extends from the inner ear to the brain and is made up of a vestibular branch, often called the vestibular nerve, and a cochlear branch, called the cochlear nerve. The vestibular and cochlear nerves lie next to one another. They also run along side other cranial nerves. People possess two of each type of vestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the left ear and one that extends from the right ear. | No
622 | NarrativeText | The vestibular nerve transmits information concern- ing balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlear nerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibular nerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called a myelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some- times develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue that results from the uncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are often called vestibular schwannomas because they are tumors that arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds the vestibular nerve. Acoustic neuromas are considered benign (non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread to other parts of the body. They can occur anywhere along the vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where the vestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canal that connects the brain and the inner ear. | No
623 | NarrativeText | An acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu- lar nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A unilateral tumor is a tumor arising from one nerve and a bilateral tumor arises from both vestibular nerves. Unilateral acoustic neuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance). Bilat- eral acoustic neuromas occur as part of a hereditary con- dition called Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). A person with NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developing acoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells. | No
624 | NarrativeText | Acoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and can take years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas remain so small that they do not cause any symptoms. As the acoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the func- tioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo and balance difficulties. If the acoustic nerve grows large enough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing loss and a ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usu- ally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin- ues to grow it can press against other nerves in the region and cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat- ening if it becomes large enough to press against and interfere with the functioning of the brain. | No
625 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
626 | Title | Causes | No
627 | NarrativeText | An acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or absence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in a nerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes in every cell of their body including their nerve cells. One NF? gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother and one NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of the father. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre- vent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic- ular the NF2 gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas. | No
628 | NarrativeText | Only one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene is necessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuro- ma. If both NF2 genes become changed or missing in one of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nerve then an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni- lateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genes become spontaneously changed or missing. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developed spontaneously is not at increased risk for having children with an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu- romas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is also possible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may be caused by changes in other genes responsible for pre- venting the formation of tumors. | No
629 | NarrativeText | Bilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is affected with the hereditary condition NF2. A person with NF2 is typically born with one unchanged and one changed or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body. Sometimes they inherit this change from their mother or father. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously when the egg and sperm come together to form the first cell of the baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50% chance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene. | No
630 | Title | 28 | No
631 | NarrativeText | A person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro- ma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon- taneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheath cells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 often develop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The mean age of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years of age versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro- mas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acoustic neuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk for developing cataracts and tumors in other nerve cells. | No
632 | NarrativeText | Most people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are not affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however, only develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlear nerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater- al tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve a number of years later. NF2 should be considered in some- one under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu- roma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and other family members diagnosed with NF2 probably is affected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataracts and other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On the other hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateral acoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family history of NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2. | No
633 | Title | Symptoms | No
634 | NarrativeText | Small acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with the functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The most common first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearing loss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin- nitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes report difficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceiving the tone of a musical instrument or sound even when their hearing appears to be otherwise normal. In most cases the hearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually over time until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi- mately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe. | No
635 | NarrativeText | Acoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve and van cause vertigo and dysequilibrium. Twenty percent of small tumors are associated with periodic vertigo, which is characterized by dizziness or a whirling sensation. Larger acoustic neuromas are less likely to cause vertigo but more likely to cause dysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium, which is characterized by minor clumsiness and a gener- al feeling of instability, occurs in nearly 50% of people with an acoustic neuroma. | No

653 | NarrativeText | If left untreated, the tumor can become large enough to press against and affect the functioning of the brain stem. The brain stem is the stalk like portion of the brain that joins the spinal cord to the cerebrum, the thinking and reasoning part of the brain. Different parts of the brain- stem have different functions such as the control of breath- ing and muscle coordination. Large tumors that impact the brain stem can result in headaches, walking difficulties (gait ataxia) and involuntary shaking movements of the muscles (tremors). In rare cases when an acoustic neuro- ma remains undiagnosed and untreated it can cause nau- sea, vomiting, lethargy and eventually coma, respiratory difficulties and death. In the vast majority of cases, how- ever, the tumor is discovered and treated long before it is large enough to cause such serious manifestations. | No

Pure tone audiometry tests to see how well someone can hear tones of different volume and pitch and speech audiometry tests to see how well someone can hear and recognize speech. An acoustic neuroma is suspected in someone with unilateral hearing loss or hearing loss that is less severe in one ear than the other ear(asymmetrical). | No
655 | NarrativeText | Sometimes an auditory brainstem response (ABR, BAER) test is performed to help establish whether someone is likely to have an acoustic neuroma. During the ABR examination, a harmless electrical impulse is passed from the inner ear to the brainstem. An acoustic neuroma can interfere with the passage of this electri- cal impulse and this interference can, sometimes be identified through the ABR evaluation. A normal ABR examination does not rule out the possibility of an acoustic neuroma. An abnormal ABR examination increases the likelihood that an acoustic neuroma is present but other tests are necessary to confirm the presence of a tumor. | No
656 | Title | Diagnosis | No
657 | NarrativeText | Anyone with symptoms of hearing loss should under- go hearing evaluations. Pure tone and speech audiometry If an acoustic neuroma is strongly suspected then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually per- formed. The MRI is a very accurate evaluation that is | No

659 | NarrativeText | Once an acoustic neuroma is diagnosed, an evalua- tion by genetic specialists such as a geneticist and genet- ic counselor may be recommended. The purpose of this evaluation is to obtain a detailed family history and check for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly suspected then DNA testing may be recommended. DNA testing involves checking the blood cells obtained from a rou- tine blood draw for the common gene changes associat- ed with NF2. | No
660 | Title | Treatment | No
661 | NarrativeText | The three treatment options for acoustic neuroma are surgery, radiation, and observation. The physician and patient should discuss the pros and cons of the differ- ent options prior to making a decision about treatment. The patient’s, physical health, age, symptoms, tumor size, and tumor location should be considered. | No
662 | Title | Microsurgery | No
663 | NarrativeText | The surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the most common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In most cases the entire tumor is removed during the surgery. If the tumor is large and causing significant symptoms, yet there is a need to preserve hearing in that ear, then only part of the tumor may be removed. During the procedure the tumor is removed under microscopic guidance and general anesthetic. Monitoring of the neighboring cranial nerves is done during the procedure so that damage to these nerves can be prevented. If preservation of hearing is a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also take place during the surgery. | No
664 | NarrativeText | Most people stay in the hospital four to seven days following the surgery. Total recovery usually takes four to six weeks. Most people experience fatigue and head discomfort following the surgery. Problems with balance and head and neck stiffness are also common. The mor- tality rate of this type of surgery is less than 2% at most major centers. Approximately 20% of patients experi- ence some degree of post-surgical complications. In most cases these complications can be managed successfully and do not result in long term medical problems. Surgery brings with it a risk of stroke, damage to the brain stem, infection, leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cra- nial nerves. Hearing loss and/or tinnitis often result from the surgery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one to five years following the surgery because of possible regrowth of the tumor. | No
665 | Title | 30 | No
666 | Title | Stereotactic Radiation therapy | No
667 | NarrativeText | During stereotactic radiation therapy, also called radiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of radia- tion are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma. The radi- ation is administered in a single large dose, under local anesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. This results in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but little radiation exposure to the surrounding area. This treat- ment approach is limited to small or medium tumors. The goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or at least limit the growth of the tumor. The long term effica- cy and risks of this treatment approach are not known. Periodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of the patient is therefore recommended. | No
668 | NarrativeText | Radiation therapy can cause hearing loss which can sometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy can also cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves, which can result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysis of the facial muscles. In many cases these symptoms are temporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the forma- tion of other benign or malignant schwannomas. This type of treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treat- ment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are pre- disposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors. | No
669 | Title | Observation | No
670 | NarrativeText | Acoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and in some cases they will stop growing and even become smaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be appro- priate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to peri- odically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluations. Long-term observation may be appropriate for example in an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma and few symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicat- ed for someone with a small and asymptomatic acoustic neuroma that was detected through an evaluation for another medical problem. Observation may also be sug- gested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the only hearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing. The dan- ger of an observational approach is that as the tumor grows larger it can become more difficult to treat. | No
671 | Title | Prognosis | No
672 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diag- nosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted. Long term hearing loss and tinnitis in the affected ear are com- mon, even if appropriate treatment is provided. Regrowth of the tumor is also a possibility following surgery or radiation therapy and repeat treatment may be necessary. The progno- sis can be poorer for those with NF2 who have an increased risk of bilateral acoustic neuromas and other tumors. | No

699 | NarrativeText | Acrocyanosis is a painless disorder caused by constric- tion or narrowing of small blood vessels in the skin of affect- ed patients. The spasm of the blood vessels decreases the amount of blood that passes through them, resulting in less blood being delivered to the hands and feet. The hands may be the main area affected. The affected areas turn blue and become cold and sweaty. Localized swelling may also occur. Emotion and cold temperatures can worsen the symptoms, while warmth can decrease symptoms. The disease is seen mainly in women and the effect of the disorder is mainly cosmetic. People with the disease tend to be uncomfortable, with sweaty, cold, bluish colored hands and feet. | No
700 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
701 | NarrativeText | The sympathetic nerves cause constriction or spasms in the peripheral blood vessels that supply blood to the extremities. The spasms are a contraction of the muscles in the walls of the blood vessels. The contraction decreases the internal diameter of the blood vessels, thereby decreasing the amount of blood flow through the affected area. The spasms occur on a persistent basis, resulting in long term reduction of blood supply to the hands and feet. Sufficient blood still passes through the blood vessels so that the tissue in the affected areas does not starve for oxygen or die. Mainly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin are affected. | No

706 | NarrativeText | Acrocyanosis usually isn’t treated. Drugs that block the uptake of calcium (calcium channel blockers) and alpha-one antagonists reduce the symptoms in most cases.

717 | NarrativeText | Acromegaly is a disorder in which the abnormal release of a particular chemical from the pituitary gland in the brain causes increased growth in bone and soft tis- sue, as well as a variety of other disturbances throughout the body. This chemical released from the pituitary gland is called growth hormone (GH). The body’s ability to | No
718 | Title | 32 | No
719 | NarrativeText | process and use nutrients like fats and sugars is also altered. In children whose bony growth plates have not closed, the chemical changes of acromegaly result in exceptional growth of long bones. This variant is called gigantism, with the additional bone growth causing unusual height. When the abnormality occurs after bone growth stops, the disorder is called acromegaly. | No
720 | Title | Description | No
721 | NarrativeText | Acromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring in approximately 50 out of every one million people (50/ 1,000,000). Both men and women are affected. Because the symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno- sis is often delayed. The majority of patients are not identified until they are middle aged. | No
722 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
723 | NarrativeText | The pituitary is a small gland located at the base of the brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releases certain chemicals, or hormones, which are important to the functioning of other organs or body systems. The pituitary hormones travel throughout the body and are involved in a large number of activities, including the regulation of growth and reproductive functions. The cause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro- duction of GH. | No
724 | NarrativeText | Under normal conditions, the pituitary receives input from another brain structure, the hypothalamus, located at the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala- mus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. For example, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone- releasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitary to release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should also direct the pituitary to stop releasing hormones. | No
725 | NarrativeText | In acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GH and ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver, GH causes production of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growth throughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stop producing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormal peaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the body begin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability to process and use nutrients like sugars and fats. | No

730 | NarrativeText | People with acromegaly have more skin tags, or out- growths of tissue, than normal. This increase in skin tags is also associated with the development of growths, called polyps, within the large intestine that may eventu- ally become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly often suffer from headaches and arthritis. The various swellings and enlargements throughout the body may press on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling or burning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness. | No
731 | NarrativeText | The most common cause of this disorder (in 90% of patients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with- in the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumors are the source of the abnormal release of GH. As these tumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within the brain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade- noma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interfering with the release of other hormones. These disruptions may be responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle of women, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women, and the abnormal production of breast milk in women. In rare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc- tion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production of GH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands, thyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggers production of an abnormal quantity of GH. | No
732 | Title | Diagnosis | No
733 | NarrativeText | Because acromegaly produces slow changes over time, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, the characteristic coarsening of the facial features is often not recognized by family members, friends, or long-time family physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by a new physician who sees the patient for the first time and is struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance. Comparing old photographs from a number of different time periods will often increase suspicion of the disease. | No
734 | NarrativeText | Because the quantity of GH produced varies widely under normal conditions, demonstrating high levels of GH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis of acromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring an Enlarged feet is one deformity caused by acromegaly. (Cus- tom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.) | No

These results, however, must be carefully inter- preted because normal laboratory values for IGF-1 vary when the patient is pregnant, undergoing puberty, elder- ly, or severely malnourished. Normal patients will show a decrease in GH production when given a large dose of sugar (glucose). Patients with acromegaly will not show this decrease, and will often show an increase in GH pro- duction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for viewing the pituitary, and for identifying and locating an adenoma. When no adenoma can be located, the search for a GHRH-producing tumor in another location begins. | No
736 | Title | Treatment | No
737 | NarrativeText | The first step in treatment of acromegaly is removal of all or part of the pituitary adenoma. Removal requires surgery, usually performed by entering the skull through the nose.

Bromocrip- tine (Parlodel) is a medication that can be taken by mouth, while octreotide (Sandostatin) must be injected every eight hours. Both of these medications are helpful in reducing GH production, but must often be taken for life and pro- duce their own unique side effects. Some patients who can- not undergo surgery are treated with radiation therapy to the pituitary in an attempt to shrink the adenoma. Radiating the pituitary may take up to 10 years, however, and may also injure/destroy other normal parts of the pituitary. | No
742 | Title | Prognosis | No
743 | NarrativeText | Without treatment, patients with acromegaly will most likely die early because of the disease’s effects on the heart, lungs, brain, or due to the development of cancer in the large intestine.

Fifty per- cent of actinomycosis cases are of the head and neck region (also called “lumpy jaw” and “cervicofacial actinomyco- sis”), 15% are in the chest, 20% are in the abdomen, and the rest are in the pelvis, heart, and brain.

772 | NarrativeText | Actinomycosis is usually caused by the bacterium Actinomyces israelii. This bacterium is normally present in the mouth but can cause disease if it enters tissues fol- lowing an injury. Actinomyces israelii is an anaerobic bacterium which means it dislikes oxygen but grows very well in deep tissues where oxygen levels are low. Tooth extraction, tooth disease, root canal treatment, jaw surgery, or poor dental hygiene can allow Actinomyces israelii to cause an infection in the head and neck region. | No

774 | Title | Diagnosis | No
775 | NarrativeText | Cervicofacial actinomycosis can be diagnosed by a fam- ily doctor or dentist and the patient may be referred to an oral surgeon or infectious disease specialist. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based upon several things. The presence of a red lump with draining sinuses on the head or neck is strongly suggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent history of tooth extraction or signs of tooth decay or poor dental hygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic examination of the fluid draining from the sinuses shows the characteristic “‘sul- fur granules” (small yellow colored material in the fluid) pro- duced by Actinomyces israelii. A biopsy may be performed to remove a sample of the infected tissue. This procedure can be performed under local anesthesia in the doctor’s office. Occa- sionally the bacteria can be cultured from the sinus tract fluid or from samples of the infected tissue. | No
776 | NarrativeText | Actinomycosis in the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, or brain can be very hard to diagnose since the symptoms often mimic those of other diseases.

798 | NarrativeText | Acupressure massage performed by a therapist can be very effective both as prevention and as a treatment for many health conditions, including headaches, general aches and pains, colds and flu, arthritis, allergies, asthma, nervous ten- sion, menstrual cramps, sinus problems, sprains, tennis elbow, and toothaches, among others. Unlike acupuncture which requires a visit to a professional, acupressure can be performed by a layperson. Acupressure techniques are fairly easy to learn, and have been used to provide quick, cost-free, and effective relief from many symptoms. Acupressure points can also be stimulated to increase energy and feelings of well-being, reduce stress, stimulate the immune system, and alleviate sexual dysfunction. | No
799 | NarrativeText | Medicine, which may be at least 2,000 years old. Chi- nese medicine has developed acupuncture, acupressure, herbal remedies, diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, and other remedies as part of its healing methods. Nearly all of the forms of Oriental medicine that are used in the West today, including acupuncture, acupressure, shiatsu, and Chinese herbal medicine, have their roots in Chinese medicine. One legend has it that acupuncture and acu- pressure evolved as early Chinese healers studied the puncture wounds of Chinese warriors, noting that certain points on the body created interesting results when stim- ulated. The oldest known text specifically on acupunc- ture points, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates back to 282 A.D. Acupressure is the non-invasive form of acupuncture, as Chinese physicians determined that stimulating points on the body with massage and pres- sure could be effective for treating certain problems. | No

At that time, a famous columnist for the New York Times, James Reston, had to undergo surgery and elected to use acupuncture for anesthesia. Later, he wrote some convincing stories on its effectiveness. Despite being neglected by mainstream medicine and the Ameri- can Medical Association (AMA), acupuncture and Chi- nese medicine became a central to alternative medicine practitioners in the United States. Today, there are mil- lions of patients who attest to its effectiveness, and near- ly 9,000 practitioners in all 50 states. | No
805 | NarrativeText | Acupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinese medicine practitioners and acupuncturists, as well as by massage therapists. Most massage schools in American include acupressure techniques as part of their bodywork programs. Shiatsu massage is very closely related to acu- pressure, working with the same points on the body and the same general principles, although it was developed over centuries in Japan rather than in China. Reflexology is a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts. Jin Shin Do is a bodywork technique with an increasing number of practitioners in America that combines acu- pressure and shiatsu principles with qigong, Reichian theory, and meditation. | No

807 | NarrativeText | Chinese medicine views the body as a small part of the universe, subject to laws and principles of harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a destinction as Western medicine does between mind and body. The Chinese system believes that emotions and mental states are every bit as influential on disease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers factors like work, environment, and relationships as fundamental to a patient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While Western medicine typically describes health as mainly physical processes composed of chemical equations and reactions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, and the organ system to describe health and the body. | No
808 | NarrativeText | Everything in the universe has properties of yin and yang. Yin is associated with cold, female, passive, down- ward, inward, dark, wet. Yang can be described as hot, male, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on. Nothing is either completely yin or yang. These two prin- ciples always interact and affect each other, although the body and its organs can become imbalanced by having either too much or too little of either. | No
809 | NarrativeText | Chi (pronounced chee, also spelled gi or ki in Japan- ese shiatsu) is the fundamental life energy. It is found in food, air, water, and sunlight, and it travels through the body in channels called meridians. There are 12 major Governing vessel 24.5 Lung 10 | No

820 | NarrativeText | Disease is viewed as an imbalance of the organs and chi in the body. Chinese medicine has developed intri- cate systems of how organs are related to physical and mental symptoms, and it has devised corresponding treatments using the meridian and pressure point net- works that are classified and numbered. The goal of acu- pressure, and acupuncture, is to stimulate and unblock the circulation of chi, by activating very specific points, called pressure points or acupoints. Acupressure seeks to stimulate the points on the chi meridians that pass close to the skin, as these are easiest to unblock and manipulate with finger pressure. | No
821 | NarrativeText | Acupressure can be used as part of a Chinese physician’s prescription, as a session of massage ther- apy, or as a self-treatment for common aches and ill- nesses. A Chinese medicine practitioner examines a patient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental and emotional activity, taking the pulse usually at the wrists, examining the tongue and complexion, and observing the patient’s demeanor and attitude, to get a complete diagnosis of which organs and meridian points are out of balance. When the imbalance is locat- ed, the physician will recommend specific pressure points for acupuncture or acupressure. If acupressure is recommended, the patient might opt for a series of treatments from a massage therapist. | No
822 | NarrativeText | In massage therapy, acupressurists will evaluate a patient’s symptoms and overall health, but a massage therapist’s diagnostic training isn’t as extensive as a Chinese physician’s. In a massage therapy treatment, a person usually lies down on a table or mat, with thin clothing on. The acupressurist will gently feel and pal- pate the abdomen and other parts of the body to deter- mine energy imbalances. Then, the therapist will work with different meridians throughout the body, depend- ing on which organs are imbalanced in the abdomen. The therapist will use different types of finger move- ments and pressure on different acupoints, depending on whether the chi needs to be increased or dispersed at different points. The therapist observes and guides the energy flow through the patient’s body throughout the session. Sometimes, special herbs (Artemesia vulgaris or moxa) may be placed on a point to warm it, a process called moxibustion. A session of acupressure is general- ly a very pleasant experience, and some people experi- ence great benefit immediately. For more chronic con- ditions, several sessions may be necessary to relieve and improve conditions. | No
823 | NarrativeText | Acupressure massage usually costs from $30—70 per hour session. A visit to a Chinese medicine physician or acupuncturist can be more expensive, comparable to a visit to an allopathic physician if the practitioner is an MD. Insurance reimbursement varies widely, and con- sumers should be aware if their policies cover alternative treatment, acupuncture, or massage therapy. | No
824 | Title | Self-treatment | No
825 | NarrativeText | Acupressure is easy to learn, and there are many good books that illustrate the position of acupoints and meridians on the body. It is also very versatile, as it can be done anywhere, and it’s a good form of treatment for spouses and partners to give to each other and for parents to perform on children for minor conditions. | No
826 | NarrativeText | While giving self-treatment or performing acupressure on another, a mental attitude of calmness and attention is important, as one person’s energy can be used to help another’s. Loose, thin clothing is recommended. There are three general techniques for stimulating a pressure point. | No
827 | ListItem | * Tonifying is meant to strengthen weak chi, and is done by pressing the thumb or finger into an acupoint with a firm, steady pressure, holding it for up to two minutes. | No
828 | ListItem | ¢ Dispersing is meant to move stagnant or blocked chi, and the finger or thumb is moved in a circular motion or slightly in and out of the point for two minutes. | No
829 | ListItem | * Calming the chi in a pressure point utilizes the palm to cover the point and gently stroke the area for about two minutes. | No
830 | NarrativeText | There are many pressure points that are easily found and memorized to treat common ailments from headaches to colds. | No
831 | ListItem | + For headaches, toothaches, sinus problems, and pain in the upper body, the “LI4” point is recommended. It is located in the web between the thumb and index finger, on the back of the hand. Using the thumb and index fin- ger of the other hand, apply a pinching pressure until the point is felt, and hold it for two minutes. Pregnant women should never press this point. | No
832 | ListItem | ¢ To calm the nerves and stimulate digestion, find the “CV 12” point that is four thumb widths above the navel in the center of the abdomen. Calm the point with the palm, using gentle stroking for several minutes. | No
833 | ListItem | ¢ To stimulate the immune system, find the “TH5” point on the back of the forearm two thumb widths above the wrist. Use a dispersing technique, or circular pressure with the thumb or finger, for two minutes on each arm. | No
834 | ListItem | + For headaches, sinus congestion, and tension, locate the “GB20” points at the base of the skull in the back of the head, just behind the bones in back of the ears. Disperse these points for two minutes with the fingers or thumbs. Also find the “yintang” point, which is in the middle of the forehead between the eyebrows. Disperse it with gentle pressure for two minutes to clear the mind and to relieve headaches. | No
835 | Title | Precautions | No
836 | NarrativeText | Acupressure is a safe technique, but it is not meant to replace professional health care. A physician should always be consulted when there are doubts about medical conditions. If a condition is chronic, a professional should be consulted; purely symptomatic treatment can exacer- bate chronic conditions. Acupressure should not be applied to open wounds, or where there is swelling and inflammation. Areas of scar tissue, blisters, boils, rashes, or varicose veins should be avoided. Finally, certain acu- pressure points should not be stimulated on people with high or low blood pressure and on pregnant women. | No
837 | Title | Research and general acceptance | No
838 | NarrativeText | In general, Chinese medicine has been slow to gain acceptance in the West, mainly because it rests on ideas very foreign to the scientific model. For instance, West- em scientists have trouble with the idea of chi, the invisi- ble energy of the body, and the idea that pressing on cer- tain points can alleviate certain conditions seems some- times too simple for scientists to believe. | No
839 | NarrativeText | Western scientists, in trying to account for the action of acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part of the neuroendocrine system of the body. Celebrated ortho- pedic surgeon Robert O. Becker, who was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize, wrote a book on the subject called Cross Currents: The Promise of Electromedicine; The Per- ils of Electropollution. By using precise electrical measur- ing devices, Becker and his colleagues showed that the body has a complex web of electromagnetic energy, and that traditional acupressure meridians and points contained amounts of energy that non-acupressure points did not. | No
840 | NarrativeText | The mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressure remain difficult to document in terms of the biochemical processes involved; numerous testimonials are the prima- ry evidence backing up the effectiveness of acupressure and acupuncture. However, a body of research is growing that verifies the effectiveness in acupressure and acupuncture techniques in treating many problems and in controlling pain. | No

862 | NarrativeText | The original text of Chinese medicine is the Nei Ching, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medi- cine, which is estimated to be at least 2,500 years old. Thousands of books since then have been written on the subject of Chinese healing, and its basic philosophies spread long ago to other Asian civilizations. Nearly all of the forms of Oriental medicine which are used in the West today, including acupuncture, shiatsu, acupressure mas- sage, and macrobiotics, are part of or have their roots in Chinese medicine. Legend has it that acupuncture devel- oped when early Chinese physicians observed unpredict- ed effects of puncture wounds in Chinese warriors. The oldest known text on acupuncture, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates back to 282 A.D. Although acupunc- ture is its best known technique, Chinese medicine tradi- tionally utilizes herbal remedies, dietary therapy, lifestyle changes and other means to treat patients. | No

866 | NarrativeText | Several forms of acupuncture are being used today in America. Japanese acupuncture uses extremely thin nee- dles and does not incorporate herbal medicine in its prac- tice. Auricular acupuncture uses acupuncture points only on the ear, which are believed to stimulate and balance internal organs. In France, where acupuncture is very pop- ular and more accepted by the medical establishment, neu- rologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncture based on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditional Chinese concepts, which is gaining some use in America. | No
867 | Title | Basic ideas of Chinese medicine | No
868 | NarrativeText | Chinese medicine views the body as a small part of the universe, and subject to universal laws and principles of harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does not draw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, between mind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo- tions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis- ease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac- tors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as fundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med- icine typically describes health in terms of measurable physical processes made up of chemical reactions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys- tem, and the five elements to describe health and the body. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is worthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms. | No
869 | NarrativeText | YIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy, the universe and the body can be described by two sepa- rate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang. For example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot. In gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yin is passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark and yang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downward and yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is ever completely yin or yang, but a combination of the two. These two principles are always interacting, opposing, and influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi- cine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allow the two to balance each other and exist harmoniously together.

Thus, acupuncture therapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or increase or reduce yin in particular regions of the body. | No
880 | NarrativeText | CHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med- icine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi is the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi- ble and is found in the environment in the air, water, food and sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital force that creates and animates life. We are all born with inher- ited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi from the food we eat and the air we breathe. The level and quality of a person’s chi also depends on the state of physical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travels through the body along channels called meridians. | No
881 | NarrativeText | THE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there are twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom- ach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid- ney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triple warmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Each organ has chi energy associated with it, and each organ interacts with particular emotions on the mental level. As there are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chi which can move through the body, and these move through twelve main channels or meridians. Chinese doctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptoms are caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or more organs, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from one | No
882 | Title | 42 | No
883 | NarrativeText | organ to another. Each organ has a different profile of symptoms it can manifest. | No
884 | NarrativeText | THE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theo- ry is that the world and body are made up of five main elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele- ments are all interconnected, and each element either generates or controls another element. For instance, water controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organ is associated with one of the five elements. The Chinese system uses elements and organs to describe and treat conditions. For instance, the kidney is associated with water and the heart is associated with fire, and the two organs are related as water and fire are related. If the kid- ney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fire problem in the heart, so treatment might be made by acupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/or increase energy in the kidney system. | No
885 | NarrativeText | The Chinese have developed an intricate system of how organs and elements are related to physical and mental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim- ple one. Although this system sounds suspect to Western scientists, some interesting parallels have been observed. For instance, Western medicine has observed that with severe heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but it still does not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine, this connection between the two organs has long been established. | No
886 | NarrativeText | MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi- nese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organ system or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy or treatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innate harmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors like emotions, external factors like the environment and weather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, and germs. However, infection is seen not as primarily a problem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in the energy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur. In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same, as each body has its own characteristics of symptoms and balance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flow of chi throughout the organ system, which will strength- en the body and prompt it to heal itself. | No
887 | NarrativeText | A VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing an acupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’s medical history and symptoms, both physical and emo- tional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter- view. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient to find further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, the pulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen- eral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains. From this, the practitioner will be able to determine patterns of symptoms which indicate which organs and areas are imbalanced. Depending on the problem, the acupunctur- ist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or more of the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi- ans, there are nearly 2,000 points which can be used in acupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre- quently used by traditional acupuncturists. During an individual treatment, one to twenty needles may be used, depending on which meridian points are chosen. | No
888 | NarrativeText | Acupuncture needles are always sterilized and acupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser- tion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels are being treated. Some points barely go beyond superficial layers of skin, while some acupuncture points require a depth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general- ly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinching sensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe- riences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc- turist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slight electrical current through some of them. Moxibustion may be sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa or mugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncture point or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim- ulate chi in a particular way. Also, acupuncturists some- times use cupping, during which small suction cups are placed on meridian points to stimulate them. | No
889 | NarrativeText | How long the needles are inserted also varies. Some patients only require a quick in and out insertion to clear problems and provide tonification (strengthening of health), while some other conditions might require nee- dles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit to an acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes. The number of visits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with some conditions improved in one or two sessions and others requiring a series of six or more visits over the course of weeks or months. | No
890 | NarrativeText | Costs for acupuncture can vary, depending on whether the practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-MD acupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-up vis- its usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement also varies widely, depending on the company and state. Regu- lations have been changing often. Some states authorize Medicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions, and some states have mandated that general coverage pay for acupuncture. Consumers should be aware of the provisions for acupuncture in their individual policies. | No
891 | Title | Precautions | No
892 | NarrativeText | Acupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If a patient is in doubt about a medical condition, more than one physician should be consulted. Also, a patient should always feel comfortable and confident that their acupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trained. | No
893 | Title | Research and general acceptance | No
894 | NarrativeText | Mainstream medicine has been slow to accept acupunc- ture; although more MDs are using it, the American Medical Association does not recognize it as a specialty. The reason for this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult to scientifically understand or measure, such as the invisible energy of chi in the body. Western medicine, admitting that acupuncture works in many cases, has theorized that the energy meridians are actually part of the nervous system and that acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, or natural pain killers, into the bloodstream. Despite the ambi- guity in the biochemistry involved, acupuncture continues to show effectiveness in clinical tests, from reducing pain to alleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and research in acupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alterna- tive Medicine of the National Institute of Health is currently funding research in the use of acupuncture for treating depression and attention-deficit disorder. | No

909 | Title | Description | No
910 | NarrativeText | The kidneys are the body’s natural filtration system. They perform the critical task of processing approximate- ly 200 quarts of fluid in the bloodstream every 24 hours. Waste products like urea and toxins, along with excess fluids, are removed from the bloodstream in the form of urine. Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney func- tioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins begin to accumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids build up in the bloodstream, the patient with acute kidney failure may become puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands, and feet. Their blood pressure typically begins to rise, and they may experience fatigue and nausea. | No
911 | NarrativeText | Unlike chronic kidney failure, which is long term and irreversible, acute kidney failure is a temporary con- dition. With proper and timely treatment, it can typically be reversed. Often there is no permanent damage to the kidneys. Acute kidney failure appears most frequently as a complication of serious illness, like heart failure, liver failure, dehydration, severe burns, and excessive bleed- ing (hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an obstruc- tion to the urinary tract or as a direct result of kidney dis- ease, injury, or an adverse reaction to a medicine. | No
912 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
913 | NarrativeText | Acute kidney failure can be caused by many differ- ent illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditions fall into three main categories: prerenal, postrenal, and intrarenal conditions. | No
914 | NarrativeText | Prerenal conditions do not damage the kidney, but can cause diminished kidney function. They are the most common cause of acute renal failure, and include: ¢ dehydration * hemorrhage | No
915 | ListItem | * septicemia, or sepsis + heart failure | No
916 | ListItem | « liver failure * burns | No
917 | NarrativeText | Postrenal conditions cause kidney failure by obstruct- ing the urinary tract. These conditions include: + inflammation of the prostate gland in men (prostatitis) | No
918 | ListItem | *enlargement of the prostate gland (benign prostatic hypertrophy) | No
919 | ListItem | + bladder or pelvic tumors ¢ kidney stones (calculi) | No
920 | Title | 44 | No
921 | NarrativeText | Intrarenal conditions involve kidney disease or direct injury to the kidneys. These conditions include: + lack of blood supply to the kidneys (ischemia) | No
922 | ListItem | *use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidney problems + drug abuse or overdose | No
923 | ListItem | * long-term use of nephrotoxic medications, like certain pain medicines * acute inflammation of the glomeruli, or filters, of the kidney (glomerulonephritis) | No
924 | ListItem | + kidney infections (pyelitis or pyelonephritis) | No
925 | NarrativeText | Common symptoms of acute kidney failure include: * anemia. The kidneys are responsible for producing ery- thropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking of the kidney, red blood cell production is reduced, lead- ing to anemia. | No
926 | ListItem | bad breath or bad taste in mouth. Urea in the saliva may cause an ammonia-like taste in the mouth. | No
927 | ListItem | bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and keeps bones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bones may become brittle. In children, normal growth may be stunted. Joint pain may also occur as a result of high phosphate levels in the blood. Retention of uric acid may cause gout. | No
928 | ListItem | edema. Puffiness or swelling in the arms, hands, feet, and around the eyes. | No
929 | ListItem | frequent urination. | No
930 | ListItem | foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause it to foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicate bleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder, or ureters. | No
931 | ListItem | headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches. | No
932 | ListItem | hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of fluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase. This makes blood pressure rise. | No
933 | ListItem | increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the presence of anemia may cause the patient to feel exhausted. | No
934 | ListItem | itching. Phosphorus, normally eliminated in the urine, accumulates in the blood of patients with kidney failure. An increased phosphorus level may cause the skin to itch. | No
935 | ListItem | + lower back pain. Patients suffering from certain kidney problems (like kidney stones and other obstructions) may have pain where the kidneys are located, in the small of the back below the ribs. | No
936 | ListItem | «nausea. Urea in the gastric juices may cause upset stomach. | No
937 | Title | Diagnosis | No
938 | NarrativeText | Kidney failure is diagnosed by a doctor. A nephrolo- gist, a doctor that specializes in the kidney, may be con- sulted to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treat- ment options. The patient that is suspected of having acute kidney failure will have blood and urine tests to determine the level of kidney function. A blood test will assess the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium. The kidney regulates these agents in the blood. Urine samples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hour period, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine clearance. | No
939 | NarrativeText | Determining the cause of kidney failure is critical to proper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is neces- sary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and if the kidney failure is chronic or acute. X rays, magnetic res- onance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scan (CT), ultrasound, renal biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys may be used to determine the cause of kidney failure and level of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasound of the bladder and/or ureters may also be needed. | No
940 | Title | Treatment | No
941 | NarrativeText | Treatment for acute kidney failure varies. Treatment is directed to the underlying, primary medical condition that has triggered kidney failure. Prerenal conditions may be treated with replacement fluids given through a vein, diuretics, blood transfusion, or medications. Postrenal conditions and intrarenal conditions may require surgery and/or medication. | No
942 | NarrativeText | Frequently, patients in acute kidney failure require hemodialysis, hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysis to fil- ter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the pri- mary medical condition can be controlled. | No
943 | Title | Hemodialysis | No
944 | NarrativeText | Hemodialysis involves circulating the patient’s blood outside of the body through an extracorporeal cir- cuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up of plastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or arti- ficial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors and maintains blood flow and administers dialysate. Dialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used to draw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s blood leaves the body through the vein and travels through the ECC and the dialyzer, where fluid removal takes place. | No
945 | NarrativeText | During dialysis, waste products in the bloodstream are carried out of the body. At the same time, electrolytes and other chemicals are added to the blood. The purified, chemically-balanced blood is then returned to the body. | No
946 | Title | KEY TERMS | No
947 | NarrativeText | Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)—A waste product that is formed in the liver and collects in the blood- stream; patients with kidney failure have high BUN levels. | No
948 | NarrativeText | Creatinine—A protein produced by muscle that healthy kidneys filter out. | No
949 | NarrativeText | Extracorporeal—Outside of, or unrelated to, the body. | No
950 | NarrativeText | Ischemia—A lack of blood supply to an organ or tissue. | No
951 | NarrativeText | Nephrotoxic—Toxic, or damaging, to the kidney. | No
952 | NarrativeText | Radiocontrast agents—Dyes administered to a patient for the purposes of a radiologic study. | No
953 | NarrativeText | Sepsis—A bacterial infection of the bloodstream. | No
954 | NarrativeText | Vasopressors—Medications that constrict the blood vessels. | No
955 | NarrativeText | A dialysis “run” typically lasts three to four hours, depending on the type of dialyzer used and the physical condition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times a week until acute kidney failure is reversed. | No
956 | NarrativeText | Blood pressure changes associated with hemodialy- sis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri- toneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option in these cases. | No
957 | Title | Hemofiltration | No
958 | NarrativeText | Hemofiltration, also called continuous renal replace- ment therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous blood filtra- tion therapy used to control acute kidney failure in criti- cally ill patients. These patients are typically very sick and may have heart problems or circulatory problems. They cannot handle the rapid filtration rates of hemodial- ysis. They also frequently need antibiotics, nutrition, vasopressors, and other fluids given through a vein to treat their primary condition. Because hemofiltration is continuous, prescription fluids can be given to patients in kidney failure without the risk of fluid overload. | No
959 | NarrativeText | Like hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC. A hollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer to remove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis machine, a blood pump makes the blood flow through the ECC. The volume of blood circulating through the ECC in hemofil- tration is less than that in hemodialysis. Filtration rates are slower and gentler on the circulatory system. | No
960 | Title | 45 | No
961 | ListItem | Hemofiltration treatment will generally be used until kid- ney failure is reversed. | No
962 | Title | Peritoneal dialysis | No
963 | NarrativeText | Peritoneal dialysis may be used if an acute kidney failure patient is stable and not in immediate crisis. In peritoneal dialysis (PD), the lining of the patient’s abdomen, the peritoneum, acts as a blood filter. A flexible tube-like instrument (catheter) is surgically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. During treatment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity with dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move from the patient’s blood- stream into the dialysate solution. After a certain time period, the waste-filled dialysate is drained from the abdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate. There are three type of peritoneal dialysis, which vary according to treatment time and administration method. | No
964 | NarrativeText | Peritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment option for infants and children. Their small size can make vein access difficult to maintain. It is not recommended for patients with abdominal adhesions or other abdominal defects (like a hernia) that might reduce the efficiency of the treatment. It is also not recommended for patients who suffer frequent bouts of an inflammation of the small pouches in the intestinal tract (diverticulitis). | No
965 | Title | Prognosis | No
966 | NarrativeText | Because many of the illnesses and underlying con- ditions that often trigger acute kidney failure are critical, the prognosis for these patients many times is not good. Studies have estimated overall death rates for acute kid- ney failure at 42-88%. Many people, however, die because of the primary disease that has caused the kid- ney failure. These figures may also be misleading because patients who experience kidney failure as a result of less serious illnesses (like kidney stones or dehydration) have an excellent chance of complete recovery. Early recognition and prompt, appropriate treatment are key to patient recovery. | No
967 | NarrativeText | Up to 10% of patients who experience acute kidney failure will suffer irreversible kidney damage. They will eventually go on to develop chronic kidney failure or end-stage renal disease. These patients will require long- term dialysis or kidney transplantation to replace their lost renal functioning. | No
968 | Title | Prevention | No
969 | NarrativeText | Since acute kidney failure can be caused by many things, prevention is difficult. Medications that may impair kidney function should be given cautiously. Patients with pre-existing kidney conditions who are | No
970 | Title | 46 | No
971 | NarrativeText | hospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be care- fully monitored for kidney failure complications. Treat- ments and procedures that may put them at risk for kid- ney failure (like diagnostic tests requiring radiocontrast agents or dyes) should be used with extreme caution. | No

986 | NarrativeText | Acute lymphangitis is a bacterial infection in the lymphatic vessels which is characterized by painful, red streaks below the skin surface. This is a potentially seri- ous infection which can rapidly spread to the blood- stream and be fatal. | No
987 | Title | Description | No
988 | NarrativeText | Acute lymphangitis affects a critical member of the immune system—the lymphatic system. Waste materials from nearly every organ in the body drain into the lym- phatic vessels and are filtered in small organs called lymph nodes. Foreign bodies, such as bacteria or viruses, are processed in the lymph nodes to generate an immune response to fight an infection. | No
989 | NarrativeText | In acute lymphangitis, bacteria enter the body through a cut, scratch, insect bite, surgical wound, or other skin injury. Once the bacteria enter the lymphatic system, they multiply rapidly and follow the lymphatic vessel like a highway. The infected lymphatic vessel becomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are visible below the skin surface. The growth of the bacteria occurs so rapidly that the immune system does not respond fast enough to stop the infection. | No
990 | NarrativeText | If left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissue destruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled, painful lump called an abscess may be formed in the infected area. Cellulitis, a generalized infection of the lower skin layers, may also occur. In addition, the bacte- ria may invade the bloodstream and cause septicemia. Lay people, for that reason, often call the red streaks seen in the skin “blood poisoning.” Septicemia is a very seri- ous illness and may be fatal. | No
991 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
992 | NarrativeText | Acute lymphangitis is most often caused by the bac- terium Streptococcus pyogenes. This potentially danger- ous bacterium also causes strep throat, infections of the heart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the 1990s has been called the “flesh-eating bacterium.” Staphylococci bacte- ria may also cause lymphangitis. | No
993 | NarrativeText | Although anyone can develop lymphangitis, some people are more at risk. People who have had radical mas- tectomy (removal of a breast and nearby lymph nodes), a leg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery, or recurrent lymphangitis caused by tinea pedis (a fungal infection on the foot) are at an increased risk for lymphangitis. | No
994 | NarrativeText | The characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitis are the wide, red streaks which travel from the site of infection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas are red, swollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected skin may occur. The bacterial infection causes a fever of 100-104°F (38°-40°C). In addition, a general ill feeling, muscle aches, headache, chills, and loss of appetite may be felt. | No
995 | Title | Diagnosis | No
996 | NarrativeText | If lymphangitis is suspected, the person should call his or her doctor immediately or go to an emergency room. Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed by the family doctor, infectious disease specialist, or an emer- gency room doctor. The painful, red streaks just below the skin surface and the high fever are diagnostic of acute lymphangitis. A sample of blood would be taken for cul- ture to determine whether the bacteria have entered the bloodstream.

1002 | Title | Treatment | No
1003 | NarrativeText | Because of the serious nature of this infection, treat- ment would begin immediately even before the bacterial culture results were available. The only treatment for acute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of an antibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Growing streptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly and easily by penicillin. The antibiotic clindamycin may be included in the treatment to kill any streptococci which are not growing and are in a resting state. Alternatively, a “broad spectrum” antibiotic may be used which would kill many different kinds of bacteria. | No
1004 | NarrativeText | Aspirin or other medications which reduce the pain and the fever may also be given. Medications which reduce any inflammation of the infected region may also be provided. The patient is likely to be hospitalized to administer the antibiotic and other medications and to closely monitor his or her condition. Surgical drainage of an abscess may be necessary. | No
1005 | Title | Prognosis | No
1006 | NarrativeText | Complete recovery is expected if antibiotic treatment is begun at an early stage of the infection. However, if untreated, acute lymphangitis can be a very serious and even deadly disease. Acute lymphangitis that goes untreat- ed can spread, causing tissue damage. Extensive tissue damage would need to be repaired by plastic surgery. Spread of the infection into the bloodstream could be fatal. | No

1017 | Title | Description | No
1018 | NarrativeText | APSGN develops after certain streptococcal bacteria (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) have infected the skin or throat. Antigens from the dead streptococci clump together with the antibodies that killed them. These clumps are trapped in the kidney tubules, cause the tubules to become inflamed, and impair that organs’ abil- ity to filter and eliminate body wastes. The onset of APSGN usually occurs one to six weeks (average two weeks) after the streptococcal infection. | No
1019 | NarrativeText | APSGN is a relatively uncommon disease affecting about one of every 10,000 people, although four or five times that many may actually be affected by it but show no symptoms. APSGN is most prevalent among boys between the ages of 3 and 7, but it can occur at any age. | No

1029 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of APSGN is made by taking the patient’s history, assessing his/her symptoms, and performing cer- tain laboratory tests. Urinalysis usually shows blood and protein in the urine. Concentrations of urea and creati- nine (two waste products normally filtered out of the blood by the kidneys) in the blood are often high, indi- cating impaired kidney function. A reliable, inexpensive blood test called the anti-streptolysin-O test can confirm that a patient has or has had a streptococcal infection. A throat culture may also show the presence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. | No
1030 | Title | Treatment | No
1031 | NarrativeText | Treatment of ASPGN is designed to relieve the symptoms and prevent complications. Some patients are advised to stay in bed until they feel better and to restrict fluid and salt intake. Antibiotics may be prescribed to kill any lingering streptococcal bacteria, if their presence is confirmed. Antihypertensives may be given to help control high blood pressure and diuretics may be used to reduce fluid retention and swelling. Kidney dialysis is rarely needed. | No

1091 | NarrativeText | By eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumed alcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20% have smoked marijuana. Compared to females, males are almost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers, nearly one and a half more likely to smoke a pack or more of cigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke marijuana weekly. However, among adolescents these gender dif- ferences are decreasing. Although frequent use of tobac- co, cocaine and heavy drinking appears to have remained stable in the 1990s, marijuana use increased. | No
1092 | NarrativeText | In 1999, an estimated four million Americans over the age of 12 used prescription pain relievers, sedatives, and stimulants for “nonmedical” reasons during one month. | No
1093 | NarrativeText | In the United States, 25% of the population regularly uses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5 times as many people each year as alcohol and drug abuse com- bined. According to 1998 data from the World Health Organization, there were 1.1 billion smokers worldwide and 10,000 tobacco-related deaths per day. Furthermore, in the United States, 43% of children aged 2-11 years are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, which has been implicated in sudden infant death syndrome, low birth weight, asthma, middle ear disease, pneumonia, cough, and upper respiratory infection. | No
1094 | NarrativeText | Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulim- ia nervosa, and binge eating, affect over five million American women and men. Fifteen percent of young women have substantially disordered attitudes toward eating and eating behaviors. More than 1,000 women die each year from anorexia nervosa. | No

1096 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1097 | NarrativeText | Addiction to substances results from the interaction of several factors: Drug chemistry Some substances are more addictive than others, either because they produce a rapid and intense change in mood; or because they produce painful withdrawal symptoms when stopped suddenly. | No
1098 | Title | Genetic factor | No
1099 | NarrativeText | Some people appear to be more vulnerable to addic- tion because their body chemistry increases their sensi- tivity to drugs. Some forms of substance abuse and dependence seem to run in families; and this may be the result of a genetic predisposition, environmental influ- ences, or a combination of both. | No
1100 | Title | Brain structure and function | No
1101 | NarrativeText | Using drugs repeatedly over time changes brain structure and function in fundamental and long-lasting ways. Addiction comes about through an array of changes in the brain and the strengthening of new memo- ry connections. Evidence suggests that those long-lasting brain changes are responsible for the distortions of cog- nitive and emotional functioning that characterize addicts, particularly the compulsion to use drugs. Although the causes of addiction remain the subject of ongoing debate and research, many experts now consider addiction to be a brain disease: a condition caused by persistent changes in brain structure and function. How- ever, having this brain disease does not absolve the addict of responsibility for his or her behavior, but it does explain why many addicts cannot stop using drugs by sheer force of will alone. | No
1102 | Title | Social learning | No

1108 | NarrativeText | Before the 1980s, the so-called addictive personality was used to explain the development of addiction. The addictive personality was described as escapist, impul- sive, dependent, devious, manipulative, and self-cen- tered. Many doctors now believe that these character traits develop in addicts as a result of the addiction, rather than the traits being a cause of the addiction. | No
1109 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1110 | NarrativeText | In addition to a preoccupation with using and acquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of addic- tion is based on five criteria: + loss of willpower « harmful consequences | No
1111 | ListItem | * unmanageable lifestyle * tolerance or escalation of use | No
1112 | ListItem | * withdrawal symptoms upon quitting | No
1113 | Title | Treatment | No
1114 | NarrativeText | Treatment requires both medical and social approaches. Substance addicts may need hospital treat- ment to manage withdrawal symptoms. Individual or group psychotherapy is often helpful, but only after sub- stance use has stopped. Anti-addiction medications, such as methadone and naltrexone, are also commonly used. | No
1115 | NarrativeText | The most frequently recommended social form of outpatient treatment is the twelve-step program. Such programs are also frequently combined with psychother- apy. According to a recent study reported by the Ameri- can Psychological Association (APA), anyone, regardless of his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefit from participation in 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anony- mous (NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groups exceeds the number of visits to all mental health professionals combined. There are twelve-step groups for all major substance and process addictions. | No

1161 | NarrativeText | Addison’s disease is a disorder involving disrupted functioning of the part of the adrenal gland called the cortex. This results in decreased production of two important chemicals (hormones) normally released by the adrenal cortex: cortisol and aldosterone. | No
1162 | Title | Description | No
1163 | NarrativeText | The adrenals are two glands, each perched on the upper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the gland is known as the cortex; the inner part is known as the medulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is responsible for producing different types of hormones. | No
1164 | NarrativeText | Cortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioning of nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout the body, and is considered to be one of the few hormones absolutely necessary for life. Cortisol is involved in: + the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri- ents, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins * the normal functioning of the circulatory system and the heart | No

1171 | NarrativeText | Aldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex, plays a central role in maintaining the appropriate pro- portions of water and salts in the body. When this bal- ance is upset, the volume of blood circulating throughout the body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by a drop in blood pressure. | No
1172 | NarrativeText | Addison’s disease is also called primary adrenocorti- cal insufficiency. In other words, some process interferes directly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produce its hormones. Levels of both cortisol and aldosterone drop, and numerous functions throughout the body are disrupted. | No
1173 | NarrativeText | Addison’s disease occurs in about four in every 100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all ages. | No
1174 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1175 | NarrativeText | The most common cause of Addison’s disease is the destruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenal cortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is believed to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an autoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body, responsible for identifying foreign invaders such as viruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins to identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign, and destroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction of the adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis. The remaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused by fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, coccidiomy- cosis, and cryptococcosis, which affect the adrenal gland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses called granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis, in which a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited in abnormal places throughout the body, interfering with the function of whatever structure it is present within; or invasion of the adrenal glands by cancer. | No
1176 | NarrativeText | In about 75% of all patients, Addison’s disease tends to be a very gradual, slowly developing disease. Significant symptoms are not noted until about 90% of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. The most com- mon symptoms include fatigue and loss of energy, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, muscle weakness, dizzi- ness when standing, dehydration, unusual areas of darkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As the disease progresses, the patient may appear to have very tanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark pigmentation of the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydration becomes more severe, the blood pressure will continue to drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak and light-headed. Some patients have psychiatric symp- toms, including depression and irritability. Women lose pubic and underarm hair, and stop having normal men- strual periods. | No
1177 | NarrativeText | When a patient becomes ill with an infection, or stressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly and rapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptoms of this “Addisonian crisis” include abnormal heart rhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen, uncon- trollable nausea and vomiting, a drastic drop in blood pressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness. About 25% of all Addison’s disease patients are identified due to the development of Addisonian crisis. | No
1178 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1179 | NarrativeText | Many patients do not recognize the slow progres- sion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identified when a physician notices the areas of increased pigmen- tation of the skin. Once suspected, a number of blood tests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It is not sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels, as normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead, patients are given a testing dose of another hormone called corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in the body by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro- moting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulating the production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis- ease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increase cortisol levels. | No
1180 | NarrativeText | To distinguish between primary adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of the | No
1181 | Title | 54 | No
1182 | NarrativeText | pituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in the blood are examined. Normal or high levels of ACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly, but the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to the presence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. | No
1183 | Title | Treatment | No
1184 | NarrativeText | Treatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing the missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis- onian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potent form of steroid preparation through a needle placed in a vein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss will also be treated by administering carefully balanced solu- tions through the IV. Dangerously low blood pressure may require special medications to safely elevate it until the steroids take effect. | No
1185 | NarrativeText | Patients with Addison’s disease will need to take a steroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacement for aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest of their lives. When a patient has an illness which causes nausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold down their medications), he or she will need to enter a medical facility where IV medications can be administered. When a patient has any kind of infection or injury, the normal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled. | No
1186 | Title | Prognosis | No
1187 | NarrativeText | Prognosis for patients appropriately treated with hydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent. These patients can expect to enjoy a normal lifespan. Without treatment, or with substandard treatment, patients are always at risk of developing Addisonian crisis. | No

1199 | NarrativeText | Adenoid hyperplasia is the overenlargement of the lymph glands located above the back of the mouth. | No
1200 | Title | Description | No
1201 | NarrativeText | Located at the back of the mouth above and below the soft palate are two pairs of lymph glands. The tonsils below are clearly visible behind the back teeth; the ade- noids lie just above them and are hidden from view by the palate. Together these four arsenals of immune defense guard the major entrance to the body from foreign invaders—the germs we breathe and eat. In contrast to the rest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches its greatest size in mid-childhood and recedes thereafter. In this way children are best able to develop the immunities they need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases. | No
1202 | NarrativeText | Beyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissue grows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute infec- tion, as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fight off the invaders. Often it does not completely return to its former size. Each subsequent infection leaves behind a larger set of tonsils and adenoids. To make matters worse, the sponge-like structure of these hypertrophied glands can produce safe havens for germs where the body cannot reach and eliminate them. Before antibi- otics and the reduction in infectious childhood diseases over the past few generations, tonsils and adenoids caused greater health problems. | No
1203 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1204 | NarrativeText | Most tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply caused by the normal growth pattern for that type of tis- sue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated throat infections by cold viruses, strep throat, mononucleosis, and in times gone by, diphtheria. The acute infections are usually referred to as tonsillitis, the adenoids getting little recognition because they cannot be seen without special instruments. Symptoms include painful, bright red, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes (glands) beneath the jaw, fever, and general discomfort. | No
1205 | NarrativeText | After the acute infection subsides, symptoms are gen- erated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely large tonsils can impair breathing and swallowing, although that is quite rare. Large adenoids can impair nose breathing and require a child to breathe through the mouth. Because they encircle the only connection between the middle ear and the eustachian tube, hypertrophied adenoids can also obstruct it and cause middle ear infections. | No

1213 | NarrativeText | A simple tongue blade depressing the tongue allows an adequate view of the tonsils. Enlarged tonsils may have deep pockets (crypts) containing dead tissue (necrotic debris). Viewing adenoids requires a small mir- ror or fiberoptic scope. A child with recurring middle ear infections may well have large adenoids. A throat cul- ture or mononucleosis test will usually reveal the identi- ty of the germ. | No
1214 | Title | Treatment | No
1215 | NarrativeText | It used to be standard practice to remove tonsils and/or adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or ear infection. The surgery is called tonsillectomy and ade- noidectomy (T and A). Opinion changed as it was realized that this tissue is beneficial to the development of immuni- ty. For instance, children without tonsils and adenoids pro- duce only half the immunity to oral polio vaccine. In addi- tion, treatment of ear and throat infections with antibiotics and of recurring ear infections with surgical drainage through the ear drum (tympanostomy) has greatly reduced the incidence of surgical removal of these lymph glands. | No
1216 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
1217 | NarrativeText | There are many botanical/herbal remedies that can be used alone or in formulas to locally assist the tonsils and adenoids in their immune function at the opening of the oral cavity and to tone these glands. Keeping the Eustachian tubes open is an important contribution to optimal function in the tonsils and adenoids. Food aller- gies are often the culprits for recurring ear infections, as well as tonsilitis and adenoiditis. Identification and removal of the allergic food(s) can greatly assist in alle- viating the cause of the problem. Acute tonsillitis also benefits from warm saline gargles. | No

1236 | NarrativeText | Adenoviruses were discovered in 1953. About 47 dif- ferent types have been identified since then, and about half of them are believed to cause human diseases. Infants and children are most commonly affected by adenovirus- es. Adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year, but seem to be most common from fall to spring. | No
1237 | NarrativeText | Adenoviruses are responsible for 3-5% of acute res- piratory infections in children and 2% of respiratory ill- nesses in civilian adults. They are more apt to cause infection among military recruits and other young people who live in institutional environments. Outbreaks among children are frequently reported at boarding schools and summer camps. | No
1238 | Title | Acquired immunity | No
1239 | NarrativeText | Most children have been infected by at least one adenovirus by the time they reach school age. Most adults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirus types due to infections they had as children. | No
1240 | NarrativeText | In one mode of adenovirus infection (called lytic infection because it destroys large numbers of cells), ade- noviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to one mil- lion new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5% are infec- tious). People with this kind of infection feel sick. In chronic or latent infection, a much smaller number of viruses are released and healthy cells can multiply more rapidly than they are destroyed. People who have this kind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is probably why many adults have immunity to adenoviruses without realizing they have been infected. | No
1241 | Title | Childhood infections | No
1242 | NarrativeText | In children, adenoviruses most often cause acute upper respiratory infections with fever and runny nose. Adenovirus types 1, 2, 3,5, and 6 are responsible for most of these infections. Occasionally more serious lower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, may occur. | No
1243 | NarrativeText | Adenoviruses also cause acute pharyngoconjunctival fever in children. This disease is most often caused by types 3 and 7. Symptoms, which appear suddenly and usually disappear in less than a week, include: ¢ inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis) | No

1247 | NarrativeText | As much as 51% of all hemorrhagic cystitis (inflam- mation of the bladder and of the tubes that carry urine to the bladder from the kidneys) in American and Japanese children can be attributed to adenovirus infection. A child who has hemorrhagic cystitis has bloody urine for about three days, and invisible traces of blood can be found in the urine a few days longer. The child will feel the urge to urinate frequently—but find it difficult to do so—for about the same length of time. | No
1248 | Title | Adult infections | No
1249 | NarrativeText | In adults, the most frequently reported adenovirus infection is acute respiratory disease (ARD, caused by types 4 and 7) in military recruits. Influenza-like symp- toms including fever, sore throat, runny nose, and cough are almost always present; weakness, chills, headache, and swollen lymph glands in the neck may also occur. The symptoms typically last three to five days. | No
1250 | NarrativeText | Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, caused by ade- novirus types 8, 19, and 37) was first seen in shipyard workers whose eyes had been slightly injured by chips of rust or paint. This inflammation of tissues lining the eye- lid and covering the front of the eyeball can also be caused by using contaminated contact lens solutions or by drying the hands or face with a towel used by some- one who has this infection. | No
1251 | NarrativeText | The inflamed, sticky eyelids characteristic of con- junctivitis develop 4-24 days after exposure and last between one and four weeks. Only 5-8% of patients with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis experience respiratory symptoms. One or both eyes may be affected. As symp- toms of conjunctivitis subside, eye pain and watering and blurred vision develop. These symptoms of keratitis may last for several months, and about 10% of these infections spread to at least one other member of the patient’s household. | No

1266 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1267 | NarrativeText | Although symptoms may suggest the presence of adenovirus, distinguishing these infections from other viruses can be difficult. A definitive diagnosis is based on culture or detection of the virus in eye secretions, spu- tum, urine, or stool. | No
1268 | NarrativeText | The extent of infection can be estimated from the results of blood tests that measure increases in the quan- tity of antibodies the immune system produces to fight it. Antibody levels begin to rise about a week after infection occurs and remain elevated for about a year. | No
1269 | Title | Treatment | No
1270 | NarrativeText | Treatment of adenovirus infections is usually sup- portive and aimed at relieving symptoms of the illness. Bed rest may be recommended along with medications to reduce fever and/or pain. (Aspirin should not be given to children because of concerns about Reye’s syndrome.) Eye infections may benefit from topical corticosteroids to relieve symptoms and shorten the course of the dis- ease. Hospitalization is usually required for severe pneu- monia in infants and for EKC (to prevent blindness). No effective antiviral drugs have been developed. | No

1282 | NarrativeText | An adjustment disorder is a debilitating reaction, usually lasting less than six months, to a stressful event or situation. It is not the same thing as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which usually occurs in reac- tion to a life-threatening event and can be longer lasting. | No
1283 | Title | Description | No
1284 | NarrativeText | An adjustment disorder usually begins within three months of a stressful event, and ends within six months after the stressor stops. There are many different sub- types of adjustment disorders, including adjustment dis- order with: ¢ depression | No

1286 | ListItem | * mixed anxiety and depression * conduct disturbances | No
1287 | ListItem | * mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct * unspecified | No
1288 | NarrativeText | Adjustment disorders are very common and can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, race, or lifestyle. By definition, an adjustment disorder is short-lived, unless a person is faced with a chronic recurring crisis (such as a child who is repeatedly abused). In such cases, the adjustment disorder may last more than six months. | No
1289 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1290 | NarrativeText | An adjustment disorder occurs when a person can’t cope with a stressful event and develops emotional or behavioral symptoms. The stressful event can be anything: it might be just one isolated incident, or a string of prob- lems that wears the person down. The stress might be any- thing from a car accident or illness, to a divorce, or even a certain time of year (such as Christmas or summer). | No
1291 | NarrativeText | People with adjustment disorder may have a wide variety of symptoms. How those symptoms combine depend on the particular subtype of adjustment disorder and on the individual’s personality and psychological defenses. Symptoms normally include some (but not all) of the following: * hopelessness * sadness | No

1298 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1299 | NarrativeText | It is extremely important that a thorough evaluation rule out other more serious mental disorders, since the treatment for adjustment disorder may be very different than for other mental problems. | No
1300 | NarrativeText | In order to be diagnosed as a true adjustment disor- der, the level of distress must be more severe than what would normally be expected in response to the stressor, or the symptoms must significantly interfere with a per- son’s social, job, or school functioning. Normal expres- sion of grief, in bereavement for instance, is not consid- ered an adjustment disorder. | No
1301 | Title | Treatment | No
1302 | NarrativeText | Psychotherapy (counseling) is the treatment of choice for adjustment disorders, since the symptoms are an understandable reaction to a specific stress. The type of therapy depends on the mental health expert, but it usually is short-term treatment that focuses on resolving the immediate problem. | No

Medications are not usually used to treat adjust- ment disorders, although sometimes a few days or weeks of an anti-anxiety drug can control anxiety or sleeping problems. | No
1305 | NarrativeText | Self-help groups aimed at a specific problem (such as recovering from divorce or job loss) can be extremely helpful to people suffering from an adjustment disorder. Social support, which is usually an important part of self- help groups, can lead to a quicker recovery. | No

1319 | NarrativeText | Adrenal gland cancers are rare cancers occuring in the endocrine tissue of the adrenals. They are character- ized by overproduction of adrenal gland hormones. | No
1320 | Title | Description | No
1321 | NarrativeText | Cancers of the adrenal gland are very rare. The adrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine gland with two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. The main hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and the main hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine. When tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they secrete excess amounts of these hormones. A cancer that arises in the adrenal cortex is called an adrenocortical carcino- ma and can produce high blood pressure, weight gain, excess body hair, weakening of the bones and diabetes. A cancer in the adrenal medulla is called a pheochromocy- toma and can cause high blood pressure, headache, pal- pitations, and excessive perspiration. Although these can- cers can happen at any age, most occur in young adults. | No
1322 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1323 | NarrativeText | It is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer, but some cases are associated with hereditary diseases. | No

1328 | NarrativeText | Laparoscopy—tThe insertion of a tube through the abdominal wall. It can be used to visualize the inside of the abdomen and for surgical procedures. | No
1329 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of adrenal cancer are related to the specific hormones produced by that tumor. An adrenocortical car- cinoma typically secretes high amounts of cortisol, pro- ducing Cushing’s Syndrome. This syndrome produces progressive weight gain, rounding of the face, and increased blood pressure. Women can experience men- strual cycle alterations and men can experience feminiza- tion. The symptoms for pheochromocytoma include hypertension, acidosis, unexplained fever and weight loss. Because of the hormones produced by this type of tumor, anxiety is often a feature also. | No
1330 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1331 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis for adrenal cancer usually begins with blood tests to evaluate the hormone levels. These hor- mones include epinephrine, cortisol, and testosterone. It also includes magnetic resonance imaging, and com- puted tomography scans to determine the extent of the disease. Urine and blood tests can be done to detect the high levels of hormone secreted by the tumor. | No
1332 | Title | Treatment | No
1333 | NarrativeText | Treatment is aimed at removing the tumor by surgery. In some cases, this can be done by laparoscopy. Surgery is sometimes followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Because the surgery removes the source of many important hormones, hormones must be supplemented following surgery. If adrenocortical cancer recurs or has spread to other parts of the body (metasta- sized), additional surgery may be done followed by chemotherapy using the drug mitotane. | No
1334 | Title | 60 | No

1336 | NarrativeText | As with any form of cancer, all conventional treat- ment options should be considered and applied as appro- priate. Nutritional support, as well as supporting the func- tioning of the entire person diagnosed with adrenal gland cancer through homeopathic medicine, acupuncture, vit- amin and mineral supplementation, and herbal medicine, can benefit recovery and enhance quality of life. | No
1337 | Title | Prognosis | No
1338 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for adrenal gland cancer is variable. For localized pheochromocytomas the 5-year survival rate is 95%. This rate decreases with aggressive tumors that have metastasized. The prognosis for adrenal cortical can- cer is not as good with a 5-year survival rate of 10-35%. | No

1350 | Title | Purpose | No
1351 | NarrativeText | The adrenal glands are a pair of small organs located just above the kidney, which contain two types of tissue. The adrenal cortex produces hormones that affect water balance and metabolism in the body. The adrenal medul- la produces adrenaline and noradrenaline (also called epinepherine and norepinepherine). | No
1352 | NarrativeText | An adrenal gland scan is done when too much adrenaline and noradrenaline is produced in the body and a tumor in the adrenal gland is suspected. One such situa- tion in which a tumor might be suspected is when high blood pressure (hypertension) does not respond to med- ication. Tumors that secrete adrenaline and noradrenaline can also be found outside the adrenal gland. An adrenal gland scan usually covers the abdomen, chest, and head. | No
1353 | Title | Precautions | No
1354 | NarrativeText | Adrenal gland scans are not recommended for preg- nant women because of the potential harm to the devel- oping fetus. A pregnant woman should discuss with her doctor the risks of the procedure against the benefits of the information it can provide in evaluating her individ- ual medical situation. | No
1355 | NarrativeText | People who have recently undergone tests that use barium must wait until the barium has been eliminated from their system in order to obtain accurate results from the adrenal gland scan. | No
1356 | Title | Description | No
1357 | NarrativeText | The adrenal gland scan takes several days. On the first day, a radiopharmaceutical is injected intravenously into the patient. On the second, third, and fourth day the patient is positioned under the camera for imaging. The scanning time each day takes approximately 30 minutes. It is essential that the patient remain still during imaging. | No
1358 | NarrativeText | Occasionally, the scanning process may involve fewer than three days, or it may continue several days longer. The area scanned extends from the pelvis and lower abdomen to the lower chest. Sometimes the upper legs, thighs, and head are also included. | No
1359 | Title | Preparation | No
1360 | NarrativeText | For two days before and ten days after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical, patients are given either Lugol’s solution or potassium iodine. This prevents the thyroid from taking up radioactive iodine and interfering with the scan. | No
1361 | Title | Aftercare | No
1362 | NarrativeText | The patient should not feel any adverse effects of the test and can resume normal activity immediately. Follow- up tests that might be ordered include a nuclear scan of the bones or kidney, a computed tomography scan (CT) of the adrenals, or an ultrasound of the pelvic area. | No

Androgens are produced in normal girls and women. Sometimes, one or both of the adrenal glands becomes enlarged or overactive, pro- ducing more than the usual amount of androgens. The excess androgens create masculine characteristics. | No
1387 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1388 | NarrativeText | In infants and children, adrenal virilism is usually the result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present at birth. This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The cause is usually a genetic problem that leads to severe enzyme deficiencies. In rare cases, adrenal viril- ism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor. The tumor can be benign (adrenal adenoma) or cancerous (adrenal car- cinoma). Sometimes virilism is caused by a type of tumor on a woman’s ovary (arrhenoblastoma). | No
1389 | NarrativeText | Newborn girls with adrenal virilism have external sex organs that seem to be a mixture of male and female organs (called female pseudohermaphrodism). Newborn boys with the disorder have enlarged external sex organs, and these organs develop at an abnormally rapid pace. | No
1390 | NarrativeText | Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia begin growing abnormally fast, but they stop growing earlier than normal. Later in childhood, they are typically short- er than normal but have well-developed trunks. | No
1391 | NarrativeText | Women with adrenal virilization may develop facial hair. Typically, their menstrual cycles are infrequent or absent. They may also develop a deeper voice, a more prominent Adam’s apple, and other masculine signs. | No
1392 | Title | Diagnosis | No

1394 | Title | 62 | No
1395 | NarrativeText | doctors who treat disorders of the internal organs (internists) and doctors who specialize in treating the reproductive system of women (gynecologists) may also be able to help patients with this disorder. | No
1396 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis involves performing many laboratory tests on blood samples from the patient. These tests mea- sure the concentration of different hormones. Different abnormalities of the adrenal gland produce a different pattern of hormonal abnormalities. These tests can also help determine if the problem is adrenal or ovarian. If a tumor is suspected, special x rays may be done to visual- ize the tumor in the body. Final diagnosis may depend on obtaining a tissue sample from the tumor (biopsy), and examining it under a microscope in order to verify its characteristics. | No
1397 | Title | Treatment | No
1398 | NarrativeText | Adrenal virilism caused by adrenal hyperplasia is treated with daily doses of a glucocorticoid. Usually prednisone is the drug of choice, but in infants hydrocor- tisone is usually given. Laboratory tests are usually need- ed from time to time to adjust the dosage. Girls with pseudohermaphrodism may require surgery to make their external sex organs appear more normal. If a tumor is causing the disorder, the treatment will depend on the type and location of the tumor. Information about the tumor cell type and the spread of the tumor is used to decide the best kind of treatment for a particular patient. If the tumor is cancerous, the patient will require special treatment depending on how far the cancer has advanced. Treatment can be a combination of surgery, medications used to kill cancer cells (chemotherapy), and x rays or other high energy rays used to kill cancer cells (radiation therapy). Sometimes the doctor must remove the adrenal gland and the surrounding tissues. If the tumor is benign, then surgically removing the tumor may be the best option. | No
1399 | Title | Prognosis | No
1400 | NarrativeText | Ongoing glucocorticoid treatment usually controls adrenal virilism in cases of adrenal hyperplasia, but there is no cure. If a cancerous tumor has caused the disorder, patients have a better prognosis if they have an early stage of cancer that is diagnosed quickly and has not spread. | No

1410 | NarrativeText | Adrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or both of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are paired endocrine glands, one located above each kidney, that produce hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, androgens, estrogens, aldosterone, and cortisol. Adrena- lectomy is usually performed by conventional (open) surgery, but in selected patients surgeons may use laparoscopy. With laparoscopy, adrenalectomy can be accomplished through four very small incisions. | No
1411 | Title | Purpose | No
1412 | NarrativeText | Adrenalectomy is usually advised for patients with tumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland tumors may be malignant or benign, but all typically excrete excessive amounts of one or more hormones. A successful proce- dure will aid in correcting hormone imbalances, and may also remove cancerous tumors that can invade other parts of the body. Occasionally, adrenalectomy may be recom- mended when hormones produced by the adrenal glands aggravate another condition such as breast cancer. | No
1413 | Title | Precautions | No
1414 | NarrativeText | The adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves- sels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleeding during surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie close to one of the body’s major blood vessels (the vena cava), and to the spleen and the pancreas. The surgeon needs to remove the gland(s) without damaging any of these important and delicate organs. | No
1415 | Title | Description | No
1416 | Title | Open adrenalectomy | No
1417 | NarrativeText | The surgeon may operate from any of four direc- tions, depending on the exact problem and the patient’s body type. | No
1418 | NarrativeText | In the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the abdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal, just under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to operate on only one of the adrenal glands, the incision will run under just the right or the left side of the rib cage. Some- times a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomen provides a better approach, especially if both adrenal glands are involved. | No
1419 | NarrativeText | In the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the back, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are to be removed, an incision is made on each side of the body. This approach is the most direct route to the adrenal glands, but it does not provide quite as clear a view of the surrounding structures as the anterior approach. | No
1420 | NarrativeText | In the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the patient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively obese patients. If both glands need to be removed, the surgeon must remove one gland, repair the surgical wound, turn the patient onto the other side, and repeat the entire process. | No
1421 | NarrativeText | The last approach involves an incision into the chest cavity, either with or without part of the incision into the abdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon anticipates a very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs to examine or remove nearby structures as well. | No
1422 | Title | Laparoscopic adrenalectomy | No
1423 | NarrativeText | This technique does not require the surgeon to open the body cavity. Instead, four small incisions (about 1/2 in diameter each) are made into a patient’s flank, just under the rib cage. A laparoscope, which enables the sur- geon to visualize the inside of the abdominal cavity on a television monitor, is placed through one of the incisions. The other incisions are for tubes that carry miniaturized versions of surgical tools. These tools are designed to be operated by manipulations that the surgeon makes out- side the body. | No
1424 | Title | Preparation | No
1425 | NarrativeText | Most aspects of preparation are the same as in other major operations. In addition, hormone imbalances are often a major challenge. Whenever possible, physicians will try to correct hormone imbalances through medica- tion in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumors may cause other problems such as hypertension or inad- equate potassium in the blood, and these problems also should be resolved if possible before surgery is per- formed. Therefore, a patient may take specific medicines for days or weeks before surgery. | No
1426 | NarrativeText | Most adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with a CT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look differ- ent on these tests than do cancerous tumors. Surgeons may order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy (viewing of the location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to help locate exactly where the tumor is. | No

1435 | Title | Aftercare | No
1436 | NarrativeText | Patients stay in the hospital for various lengths of time after adrenalectomy. The longest hospital stays are required for open surgery using an anterior approach; hospital stays of about three days are indicated for open surgery using the posterior approach or for laparoscopic adrenalectomy. | No
1437 | NarrativeText | The special concern after adrenalectomy is the patient’s hormone balance. There may be several sets of lab tests to define hormone problems and monitor the results of drug treatment. In addition, blood pressure problems and infections are more common after removal of certain types of adrenal tumors. | No
1438 | NarrativeText | As with most open surgery, surgeons are also con- cerned about blood clots forming in the legs and travel- ing to the lungs (venous thromboembolism), bowel prob- lems, and postoperative pain.

1453 | NarrativeText | Adrenocorticotropic hormone test (also known as an ACTH test or a corticotropin test) measures pituitary gland function. | No
1454 | Title | Purpose | No
1455 | NarrativeText | The pituitary gland produces the hormone ACTH, which stimulates the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex). ACTH causes the release of the hormones hydrocortisone (cortisol), aldosterone, and androgen. The most important of these hormones released is cortisol. The ACTH test is used to determine if too much cortisol is being produced (Cushing’s syndrome) or if not enough cortisol is being produced (Addison’s disease). | No
1456 | Title | Precautions | No
1457 | NarrativeText | ACTH has diurnal variation, meaning that the levels of this hormone vary according to the time of day. The highest levels occur in the morning hours. Testing for normal secretion, as well as for Cushing’s disease, may require multiple samples. For sequential follow-up, a blood sample analyzed for ACTH should always be drawn at the same time each day. | No
1458 | NarrativeText | ACTH can be directly measured by an analyzing method (immunoassay) in many large laboratories. How- ever, smaller laboratories are usually not equipped to per- form this test and they may need to send the blood sam- ple to a larger laboratory. Because of this delay, results may take several days to obtain. | No
1459 | Title | Description | No
1460 | NarrativeText | ACTH production is partly controlled by an area in the center of the brain (the hypothalamus) and partly controlled by the level of cortisol in the blood. When ACTH levels are too high, cortisol production increases to suppress ACTH release from the pituitary gland. If ACTH levels are too low, the hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to stimulate the pituitary gland to make more ACTH. ACTH levels rise in response to stress, emotions, injury, infection, burns, surgery, and decreased blood pressure. | No
1461 | Title | Cushing’s syndrome | No
1462 | NarrativeText | Cushing’s syndrome is caused by an abnormally high level of circulating hydrocortisone. The high level may be the result of an adrenal gland tumor or enlargement of both adrenal glands due to a pituitary tumor. The high level of hydrocortisone may be the result of taking corti- costeroid drugs for a long time. Corticosteroid drugs are widely used for inflammation in disorders like rheuma- toid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma. | No
1464 | NarrativeText | Addison’s disease is a rare disorder in which symptoms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocorti- sone and aldosterone. The most common cause of this disease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune sys- tem normally fights foreign invaders in the body like bacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the immune sys- tems attacks the body. In this case, the immune system produces antibodies that attack the adrenal glands. Addison’s disease generally progresses slowly, with symptoms developing gradually over months or years. However, acute episodes, called Addisonian crises, are brought on by infection, injury, or other stresses. Diag- nosis is generally made if the patient fails to respond to | No

1470 | NarrativeText | A person’s ACTH level is determined from a blood sample. The patient must fast from midnight until the test the next morning. This means that the patient cannot eat or drink anything after midnight except water. The patient must also avoid radioisotope scanning tests or recently administered radioisotopes prior to the blood test. | No
1471 | Title | Risks | No
1472 | NarrativeText | The risks associated with this test are minimal. They may include slight bleeding from the location where the blood was drawn. The patient may feel faint or lighthead- ed after the blood is drawn. Sometimes the patient may have an accumulation of blood under the puncture site (hematoma) after the test. | No
1473 | Title | Normal results | No
1474 | NarrativeText | Each laboratory will have its own set of normal val- ues for this test. The normal values can range from: Morning (4-8 A.M.) 8-100 pg/mL or 10-80 ng/L (SI units) Evening (8-10 P.M.) less than 50 pg/mL or less than 50 ng/L (SI units) | No
1475 | Title | Abnormal results | No
1476 | NarrativeText | In Cushing’s syndrome, high levels of ACTH may be caused by ACTH-producing tumors. These tumors may be either in the pituitary or in another area (like tumors from lung cancer or ovarian cancer). Low ACTH levels may be caused by adrenal enlargement due to high levels of cortisol and feedback to the pituitary. | No
1477 | NarrativeText | In Addison’s disease, high levels of ACTH may be caused by adrenal gland diseases. These diseases decrease adrenal hormones and the pituitary attempts to increase functioning. Low levels of ACTH may occur because of decreased pituitary function. | No

1486 | Title | Description | No
1487 | NarrativeText | Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a member of a group of diseases, leukodystrophies, that cause damage to the myelin sheath of nerve cells. Approximately one in 100,000 people is affected by ALD. There are three basic forms of ALD: childhood, adult-onset, and neonatal. The childhood form of the disease is the classical form and is the most severe. Childhood ALD is progressive and usu- ally leads to total disability or death. It affects only boys because the genetic defect is sex-linked (carried on the X chromosome). Onset usually occurs between ages four and ten and can include many different symptoms, not all of which appear together. The most common symptoms are behavioral problems and poor memory. Other symp- toms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, prob- lems with gait and coordination, fatigue, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. | No
1488 | NarrativeText | The adult-onset form of the disease, also called adrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly, is usually associated with a normal life span, and usually appears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysis of the lower limbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deteriora- tion may also been seen. Women who are carriers of the disease occasionally experience the same symptoms, as well as others, including ataxia, hypertonia (excessive muscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy, and urinary problems. The neonatal form affects both male and female infants and may produce mental retardation, facial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poor | No

1497 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1498 | NarrativeText | The genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the ability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These build up in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and fibroblasts. The build-up of very long chain fatty acids interferes with the ability of the adrenal gland to convert choles- terol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves in the white matter of the brain. Demyelinated nerve cells are unable to function properly. | No
1499 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1500 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, a biochemical test, and a family history. The biochemical test detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids in samples from amniocentesis, chorionic villi, plasma, red blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family history may indi- cate the likelihood of ALD because the disease is carried on the X-chromosome by the female lineage of families. | No
1501 | Title | Treatment | No
1502 | NarrativeText | Treatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating the symptoms and supporting the patient with physical therapy, psychological counseling, and special education in some cases. There is no cure for this disease, and there are no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve and brain cells. Dietary measures consist of reducing the intake of foods high in fat, which are a source of very long chain fatty acids. A mixture called Lorenzo’s Oil has been shown to reduce the level of long chain fatty acids if used long term; however, the rate of myelin loss is unaffected. Experimental bone marrow transplanta- tion has not been very effective. | No

1513 | NarrativeText | Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also called acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a type of lung (pulmonary) failure that may result from any dis- ease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect in the lungs. ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn- drome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up one of the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail- ure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose lungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is a true medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdown of the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid from leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lung into the breathing sacs (the alveoli). | No
1514 | Title | Description | No
1515 | NarrativeText | Another name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal name is misleading, because children, as well as adults, may be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels, or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacs at the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi). | No
1516 | NarrativeText | This is the all-important site where oxygen passes from air that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all parts of the body. Any form of lung injury that damages this point of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction, will allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli, eventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The result is the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS is one of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, the other being heart failure. | No
1517 | NarrativeText | Along with fluid there is a marked increase in inflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left over from damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi- al derived from blood in the tissues. Typically these materials join together with large molecules in the blood (proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem- branes are very prominent in premature infants who develop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often called hyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe or lasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather become scarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor- mal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of the lung to become narrower, and in time they, too, may become scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungs as a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes much harder for the patient to breathe. | No
1518 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1519 | NarrativeText | A very wide range of diseases or toxic substances, including some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include: ¢ Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents when regurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from nearly drowning. | No

1538 | NarrativeText | Usually ARDS develops within one to two days of the original illness or injury. The person begins to take rapid but shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope may hear “‘crackling” or wheez- ing sounds. The low blood oxygen content may cause the skin to appear mottled or even blue. As fluid continues to fill the breathing sacs, the patient may have great trouble breathing, take very rapid breaths, and gasp for air. | No
1539 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1540 | NarrativeText | A simple test using a device applied to the ear will show whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen, and this can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken from an artery. The chest x ray may be normal in the early stages, but, in a short time, fluid will be seen where it does not belong. The two lungs are about equally affected. A heart of normal size indicates that the problem actually is ARDS and not heart failure. Another way a physician can distin- guish between these two possibilities is to place a catheter | No
1541 | Title | 68 | No
1542 | NarrativeText | into a vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung. In this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capillaries can be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary capillar- ies is elevated in heart failure, but normal in ARDS. | No
1543 | Title | Treatment | No
1544 | NarrativeText | The three main goals in treating patients with ARDS are: ¢ To treat whatever injury or disease has caused ARDS. Examples are: to treat septic infection with the proper antibiotics, and to reduce the level of oxygen therapy if ARDS has resulted from a toxic level of oxygen. | No
1545 | ListItem | * To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid to leak out of the blood vessels. At present there is no cer- tain way to achieve this. Certain steroid hormones have been tried because they can combat inflammation, but the actual results have been disappointing. | No
1546 | ListItem | * To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until the lung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen delivered by a face mask is not enough, the patient is placed on a ventilator, which takes over breathing, and, through a tube placed in the nose or mouth (or an incision in the windpipe), forces oxygen into the lungs. This treatment must be closely supervised, and the pressure adjusted so that too much oxygen is not delivered. | No
1547 | NarrativeText | Patients with ARDS should be cared for in an inten- sive care unit, where experienced staff and all needed equipment are available. Enough fluid must be provided, by vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration. Also, the patient’s nutritional state must be maintained, again by vein, if oral intake is not sufficient. | No
1548 | Title | Prognosis | No
1549 | NarrativeText | If the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin to heal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other organs, such as the kidneys. There always is a risk that bacterial pneumonia will develop at some point. Without prompt treatment, as many as 90% of patients with ARDS can be expected to die. With modern treatment, however, about half of all patients will survive. Those who do live usually recover completely, with little or no long-term breathing difficulty. Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on a ventilator, but it may improve in the months after the patient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particular patient will recover depends to a great extent on whether the primary disease that caused ARDS to develop in the first place can be effectively treated. | No
1550 | Title | Prevention | No
1551 | NarrativeText | The only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those dis- eases and harmful conditions that damage the lung. For instance, the danger of aspirating stomach contents into the lungs can be avoided by making sure a patient does not eat shortly before receiving general anesthesia. If a patient needs oxygen therapy, as low a level as possible should be given. Any form of lung infection, or infection anywhere in the body that gets into the blood, must be treated promptly to avoid the lung injury that causes ARDS. | No

1566 | NarrativeText | Starting at what is commonly called middle age, oper- ations of the human body begin to be more vulnerable to daily wear and tear; there is a general decline in physical, and possibly mental, functioning. In the Western countries, the length of life is often into the 70s. The upward limit of the life span, however, can be as high as 120 years. During the latter half of life, an individual is more prone to have problems with the various functions of the body and to develop any number of chronic or fatal diseases. The car- diovascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductive and urinary systems are particularly affected. The most common diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease. | No

The aging of the cells of each individual is programmed into the genes, and there is a preset number of possible reju- venations in the life of a given cell.

1590 | ListItem | Immunological theory. There are changes in the immune system as it begins to wear out, and the body is more prone to infections and tissue damage, which may finally cause death. Also, as the system breaks down, the body is more apt to have autoimmune reactions, in which the body’s own cells are mistaken for foreign material and are destroyed or damaged by the immune system. | No

1627 | NarrativeText | In Ayurvedic medicine, aging is described as a process of increased vata, in which there is a tendency to become thinner, drier, more nervous, more restless, and more fearful, while having a loss of appetite as well as sleep. Bananas, almonds, avocados, and coconuts are some of the foods used in correcting such conditions. One of the main herbs used for such conditions is gotu kola (Centella asiatica), which is used to revitalize the nervous system and brain cells and to fortify the immune system. Gotu kola is also used to treat memory loss, anx- iety, and insomnia. | No
1628 | NarrativeText | In Chinese medicine, most symptoms of aging are regarded as symptoms of a yin deficiency. Moistening foods such as millet, barley soup, tofu, mung beans, wheat germ, spirulina, potatoes, black sesame seeds, walnuts, and flax seeds are recommended. Jing tonics may also be used. These include deer antler, dodder seeds, processed rehmannia, longevity soup, mussels, and chicken. | No

1651 | NarrativeText | The word agoraphobia is derived from Greek words literally meaning “fear of the marketplace.” The term is used to describe an irrational and often disabling fear of being out in public. | No
1652 | Title | Description | No
1653 | NarrativeText | Agoraphobia is just one type of phobia, or irrational fear. People with phobias feel dread or panic when they face certain objects, situations, or activities. People with agoraphobia frequently also experience panic attacks, but panic attacks, or panic disorder, are not a requirement for a diagnosis of agoraphobia. The defining feature of agoraphobia is anxiety about being in places from which escape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in which help might be unavailable. The person suffering from agoraphobia usually avoids the anxiety-provoking situa- tion and may become totally housebound. | No
1654 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
1655 | NarrativeText | Agoraphobia is the most common type of phobia, and it is estimated to affect between 5-12% of Americans within their lifetime. Agoraphobia is twice as common in women as in men and usually strikes between the ages of 15-35. | No
1656 | NarrativeText | The symptoms of the panic attacks which may accompany agoraphobia vary from person to person, and may include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations (a feeling of the heart pounding against the chest), jitters, fatigue, tingling in the hands and feet, nausea, a rapid pulse or breathing rate, and a sense of impending doom. | No
1657 | NarrativeText | Agoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be the result of a number of physical and environmental factors. For instance, they have been associated with biochemical imbalances, especially related to certain neurotransmit- ters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain. People who have a panic attack in a given situation (e.g., a shop- ping mall) may begin to associate the panic with that sit- uation and learn to avoid it. According to some theories, irrational anxiety results from unresolved emotional con- flicts. All of these factors may play a role to varying extents in different cases of agoraphobia. | No
1658 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1659 | NarrativeText | People who suffer from panic attacks should discuss the problem with a physician. The doctor can diagnose the underlying panic or anxiety disorder and make sure the symptoms aren’t related to some other underlying medical condition. | No
1660 | NarrativeText | The doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia based primarily on the patient’s description of his or her symptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiences anxiety in situations where escape is difficult or help is unavailable—or in certain situations, such as being alone. While many people are somewhat apprehensive in these situations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person’s active avoidance of the feared situation impairs his or her ability to work, socialize, or otherwise function. | No
1661 | Title | Treatment | No
1662 | NarrativeText | Treatment for agoraphobia usually consists of both medication and psychotherapy. Usually, patients can benefit from certain antidepressants, such as amitripty- line (Elavil), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertra- line (Zoloft). In addition, patients may manage panic attacks in progress with certain tranquilizers called ben- zodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clon- azepam (Klonipin). | No
1663 | NarrativeText | The mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and other phobias is cognitive behavioral therapy. A specific tech- nique that is often employed is called desensitization. The patient is gradually exposed to the situation that usu- ally triggers fear and avoidance, and, with the help of breathing or relaxation techniques, learns to cope with the situation. This helps break the mental connection between the situation and the fear, anxiety, or panic. Patients may also benefit from psychodynamically ori- ented psychotherapy, discussing underlying emotional conflicts with a therapist or support group. | No

AIDS is the advanced form of infection with the HIV virus, which may not cause recognizable disease for a long period after the initial exposure (latency). No vaccine is currently available to prevent HIV infection. At present, all forms of AIDS therapy are focused on improving the quality and length of life for AIDS patients by slowing or halting the replication of the virus and treating or prevent- ing infections and cancers that take advantage of a per- son’s weakened immune system. | No

Of these patients, 44% are gay or bisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenous drug users, and 17% are women. In addition, approximate- ly 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with HIV infec- tion. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 33 million adults and 1.3 million children worldwide were living with HIV/AIDS as of 1999 with 5.4 million being newly infected that year. Most of these cases are in the developing countries of Asia and Africa. | No

Breast feeding increases the risk of transmission by 10-20%. The use of zidovu- dine (AZT) during pregnancy, however, can decrease the risk of transmission to the baby. | No
1690 | ListItem | + Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products. With the introduction of blood product screening in the mid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in blood transfusions has dropped to one in every 100,000 trans- fused. With respect to HIV transmission among drug abusers, risk increases with the duration of using injec- tions, the frequency of needle sharing, the number of persons who share a needle, and the number of AIDS cases in the local population. | No
1691 | NarrativeText | AIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk factors for HIV transmission vary according to category: ¢ Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who do not practice safe sex, those who are not monoga- mous, those who participate in anal intercourse, and those who have sex with a partner with symptoms of advanced HIV infection and/or other sexually trans- mitted diseases (STDs). In the United States and Europe, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infec- tion have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas in Africa, the disease is spread primarily through sexual intercourse among heterosexuals. | No
1692 | ListItem | Transmission in pregnancy. High-risk mothers include women married to bisexual men or men who have an abnormal blood condition called hemophilia and require blood transfusions, intravenous drug users, and women living in neighborhoods with a high rate of HIV * Needle sticks among health care professionals. Present studies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a nee- dle stick is about one in 250. This rate can be decreased if the injured worker is given AZT, an anti-retroviral medica- tion, in combination with other medication. | No

1695 | NarrativeText | AIDS in women is a serious public health concern. Women exposed to HIV infection through heterosexual contact are the most rapidly growing risk group in the United States population.

1699 | NarrativeText | Since AIDS can be transmitted from an infected moth- er to the child during pregnancy, during the birth process, or through breast milk, all infants born to HIV-positive moth- ers are a high-risk group. As of 2000, it was estimated that 87% of HIV-positive women are of childbearing age; 41% of them are drug abusers. Between 15-30% of children born to HIV-positive women will be infected with the virus. | No
1700 | NarrativeText | AIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of death in chil- dren between one and four years of age. The interval between exposure to HIV and the development of AIDS is shorter in children than in adults. Infants infected with HIV have a 20-30% chance of developing AIDS within a year and dying before age three. In the remainder, AIDS pro- gresses more slowly; the average child patient survives to seven years of age. Some survive into early adolescence. | No
1701 | NarrativeText | processes: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner- vous system dysfunction. | No
1702 | NarrativeText | Immunodeficiency describes the condition in which the body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or is not functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiency results from the way that the virus binds to a protein called CD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certain subtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4 cells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, the virus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptor called a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry of the virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particu- lar, CCRS, has gotten recent attention after studies showed that defects in its structure (caused by genetic mutations) cause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed. Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to the develop- ment of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of the CCRS gene or target the CCRS receptor. | No

1704 | NarrativeText | Because HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS is a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organ systems. HIV attacks the body through three disease Once HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate intra- cellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not com- pletely understood. In addition to killing some lympho- cytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of | No
1705 | NarrativeText | AIDS the remaining CD4 cells. Because the immune system cells are destroyed, many different types of infections and cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakened immune system (opportunistic) can develop. | No
1706 | NarrativeText | Autoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s immune system produces antibodies that work against its own cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced in response to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, protein or particle called an antigen. In this case, the body pro- duces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are nec- essary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair. Once bound, the antibodies mark the platelets for removal from the body, and they are filtered out by the spleen. Some AIDS patients develop a disorder, called immune-related thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), in which the number of blood platelets drops to abnormally low levels. | No
1707 | NarrativeText | As of 2000, researchers do not know precisely how HIV attacks the nervous system since the virus can cause damage without infecting nerve cells directly. One theory is that, once infected with HIV, one type of immune sys- tem cell, called a macrophage, begins to release a toxin that harms the nervous system. | No
1708 | NarrativeText | The course of AIDS generally progresses through three stages, although not all patients will follow this progression precisely: Acute retroviral syndrome Acute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describe a group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosis and that may be the first sign of HIV infection in 50-70% of all patients and 45-90% of women. Most patients are not recognized as infected during this phase and may not seek medical attention. The symptoms may include fever, fatigue, muscle aches, loss of appetite, digestive disturbances, weight loss, skin rashes, headache, and chronically swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Approximately 25-33% of patients will experience a form of meningitis during this phase in which the mem- branes that cover the brain and spinal cord become inflamed. Acute retroviral syndrome develops between one and six weeks after infection and lasts for two to three weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicate the presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of the viral p24 antigen in the blood. | No
1709 | Title | Latency period | No
1710 | NarrativeText | PERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY (PGL). Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or PGL, is a con- dition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painless swellings in the lymph nodes during the latency period. The lymph nodes that are most frequently affected by PGL are those in the areas of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits. PGL affects between 50-70% of patients during latency. | No
1711 | NarrativeText | CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will develop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and general weakness. HIV may also cause a combination of food malabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabo- lism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting or wasting syndrome. | No
1712 | NarrativeText | OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the course of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a yeast infection in the mouth called thrush, open sores or ulcers, or other infections of the mouth; diarrhea and other gas- trointestinal symptoms that cause malnutrition and weight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; and degeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs. HIV infection of the nervous system leads to general loss of strength, loss of reflexes, and feelings of numbness or burning sensations in the feet or lower legs. | No
1713 | Title | Late-stage disease (ADS) | No
1714 | NarrativeText | AIDS is usually marked by a very low number of CD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the frequency of opportunistic infections and cancers. Doctors monitor the number and proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in the patient’s blood in order to assess the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of different medications. About 10% of infected individuals never progress to this overt stage of the disease and are referred to as nonpro- gressors. | No
1715 | NarrativeText | OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s CD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm’, he or she is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infections. The infectious organisms may include the following: ¢ Fungi. The most common fungal disease associated with AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). PCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% of AIDS patients. It is an important measure of a patient’s prognosis. Other fungal infections include a yeast infection of the mouth (candidiasis or thrush) and cryptococcal meningitis. | No

1768 | NarrativeText | Almost all the symptoms of AIDS can occur with other diseases. The general physical examination may range from normal findings to symptoms that are closely associated with AIDS. These symptoms are hairy leuko- plakia of the tongue and Kaposi’s sarcoma. When the BLOOD TESTS (SEROLOGY). The first blood test for AIDS was developed in 1985. At present, patients who are being tested for HIV infection are usually given an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for the presence of HIV antibody in their blood. Positive ELISA results are then tested with a Western blot or immunofluo- rescence (IFA) assay for confirmation. The combination of the ELISA and Western blot tests is more than 99.9% | No
1769 | NarrativeText | accurate in detecting HIV infection within four to eight weeks following exposure. The polymerase chain reac- tion (PCR) test can be used to detect the presence of viral nucleic acids in the very small number of HIV patients who have false-negative results on the ELISA and West- ern blot tests. These tests are also used to detect viruses and bacterium other than HIV and AIDS. | No
1770 | NarrativeText | OTHER LABORATORY TESTS. In addition to diagnos- tic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are used to track the course of AIDS in patients that have already been diagnosed. These include blood counts, viral load tests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements of B,- microglobulin (B,M). | No
1771 | NarrativeText | Doctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose the presence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or other dis- ease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue biopsies, samples of cerebrospinal fluid, and sophisticated imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography scans (CT) are used to diagnose AIDS-related cancers, some opportunistic infections, damage to the central nervous system, and wasting of the muscles. Urine and stool samples are used to diagnose infections caused by parasites. AIDS patients are also given blood tests for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases. | No
1772 | Title | Diagnosis in children | No
1773 | NarrativeText | Diagnostic blood testing in children older than 18 months is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening confirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diag- nosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24 antigen testing. | No
1774 | NarrativeText | In terms of symptoms, children are less likely than adults to have an early acute syndrome. They are, howev- er, likely to have delayed growth, a history of frequent illness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood cell count, failure to gain weight, and unexplained fevers. Children with AIDS are more likely to develop bacterial infec- tions, inflammation of the lungs, and AIDS-related brain disorders than are HIV-positive adults. | No
1775 | Title | Treatment | No
1776 | NarrativeText | Treatment for AIDS covers four considerations: TREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCIES. Most AIDS patients require complex long-term treatment with medications for infectious dis- eases. This treatment is often complicated by the devel- opment of resistance in the disease organisms. AIDS- related malignancies in the central nervous system are usually treated with radiation therapy. Cancers else- where in the body are treated with chemotherapy. | No
1777 | Title | 80 | No
1778 | NarrativeText | PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Prophylactic treatment is treatment that is given to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a history of Pneumocystis pneumonia; with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm’ or 14% of lymphocytes; weight loss; or thrush should be given prophylactic medications. The three drugs given are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dap- sone, or pentamidine in aerosol form. | No
1779 | NarrativeText | ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In recent years researchers have developed drugs that suppress HIV replication, as distinct from treating its effects on the body. These drugs fall into three classes: * Nucleoside analogues. These drugs work by interfering with the action of HIV reverse transcriptase inside infect- ed cells, thus ending the virus’ replication process. These drugs include zidovudine (sometimes called azidothymi- dine or AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavu- dine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and abacavir (ABC). | No
1780 | ListItem | + Protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors can be effective against HIV strains that have developed resistance to nucleoside analogues, and are often used in combination with them. These compounds include saquinavir, riton- avir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir. | No
1781 | ListItem | * Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This is a new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are available, nevirapine, which was approved first, delavirdine and efavirin. | No
1782 | NarrativeText | Treatment guidelines for these agents are in constant change as new medications are developed and intro- duced. Two principles currently guide doctors in working out drug regimens for AIDS patients: using combinations of drugs rather than one medication alone; and basing treatment decisions on the results of the patient’s viral load tests. | No
1783 | NarrativeText | STIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION. Because many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormal- ly low levels of both red and white blood cells, they may be given medications to stimulate blood cell production. Epoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be given to anemic patients. Patients with low white blood cell counts may be given filgrastim or sargramostim. | No
1784 | Title | Treatment in women | No
1785 | NarrativeText | Treatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu- larly important in that anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to reduce transmission to the infant by 65%. | No
1786 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
1787 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped into two categories: those intended to help the immune sys- tem and those aimed at pain control. Treatments that may enhance the function of the immune system include Chinese herbal medicine and western herbal medicine, macrobiotic and other special diets, guided imagery and creative visualization, homeopathy, and vitamin therapy. Pain control therapies include hydrotherapy, reiki, acupuncture, meditation, chiropractic treatments, and therapeutic massage. Alternative therapies can also be used to help with side effects of the medications used in the treatment of AIDS. | No
1788 | Title | Prognosis | No
1789 | NarrativeText | At the present time, there is no cure for AIDS. | No
1790 | NarrativeText | Treatment stresses aggressive combination drug therapy for those patients with access to the expensive medications and who tolerate them adequately. The use of these multi-drug therapies has significantly reduced the numbers of deaths, in this country, resulting from AIDS. The data is still inconclusive, but the potential exists to possibly prolong life indefinitely using these and other drug therapies to boost the immune system, keep the virus from replicating, and ward off opportunis- tic infections and malignancies. | No
1791 | NarrativeText | Prognosis after the latency period depends on the patient’s specific symptoms and the organ systems affected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related lym- phomas of the central nervous system die within two to three months of diagnosis; those with systemic lym- phomas may survive for eight to ten months. | No
1792 | Title | Prevention | No
1793 | NarrativeText | As of 2001, there is no vaccine effective against AIDS. Several vaccines are currently being investigated, however, both to prevent initial HIV infection and as a therapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from progressing to full-blown AIDS. | No
1794 | NarrativeText | In the meantime, there are many things that can be done to prevent the spread of AIDS: *Be monogamous and practice safe sex. Individuals must be instructed in the proper use of condoms and urged to practice safe sex. Besides avoiding the risk of HIV infection, condoms are successful in preventing other sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted preg- nancies. Before engaging in a sexual relationship with someone, get tested for HIV infection. | No
1795 | ListItem | ¢ Avoid needle sharing among intravenous drug users. | No
1796 | ListItem | ¢ Although blood and blood products are carefully moni- tored, those individuals who are planning to undergo major surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of time to prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion. | No
1797 | ListItem | ¢ Healthcare professionals must taken all necessary pre- cautions by wearing gloves and masks when handling body fluids and preventing needle-stick injuries. | No
1798 | ListItem | - If you suspect that you may have become infected, get tested for HIV infection. If treated aggressively early on, the development of AIDS may be postponed indefi- nitely. If HIV infection is confirmed, it is also vital to let your sexual partners know so that they can be tested and, if necessary, receive medical attention. | No

1815 | Title | Definition | No
1816 | NarrativeText | AIDS tests, short for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome tests, cover a number of different procedures used in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV patients. These tests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serology is the branch of immunology that deals with the contents and characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear light yellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cells form a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in blood serum and its effects on each patient’s immune system. | No
1817 | Title | Purpose | No
1818 | NarrativeText | AIDS serology serves several different purposes. Some AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con- firm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres- sion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat- ment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used to screen blood donations for safe use in transfusions. | No
1819 | NarrativeText | In order to understand the different purposes of the blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to understand how HIV infection affects human blood and the immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters the blood stream of a new host in the following ways: * by sexual contact * by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and urine) | No
1820 | ListItem | * by transmission during pregnancy, or + through transfusion of infected blood products | No
1821 | NarrativeText | A retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with- in new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4, which is found on the surface of certain subtypes of white blood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, and monocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate and kill the cell in ways that are still not completely under- stood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4 cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cells and B cells) in the human immune system to respond to infections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce as they normally would in response to the HIV virus, and B cells are not stimulated to respond to the infection. | No

1826 | Title | Description | No
1827 | Title | Diagnostic tests | No
1828 | NarrativeText | Diagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to persons in high-risk populations who may have been exposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms of AIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop a detectable level of antibody within three months of infec- tion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibody in the blood is called seroconversion, and persons who have become HIV-positive are called seroconverters. | No
1829 | NarrativeText | It is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating the virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstrating the presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture, however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—it takes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. More common are blood tests that work by detecting the pres- ence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex- pensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting 99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination to screen patients and confirm diagnoses. | No
1830 | NarrativeText | ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA). This type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans- fusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA test for HIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well or beads. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added, and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou- pled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of a substance that will cause the enzyme to react by forming a color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can measure the color. The name of the test is derived from the use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec- ond antibody. | No
1831 | NarrativeText | The latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen- sitive to HIV. Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi- tive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low- risk group. Because this result is likely to be a false-posi- tive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample of the patient's blood. If the second ELISA is positive, the result should be confirmed by the Western blot test. | No
1832 | NarrativeText | WESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot or immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure to confirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing, HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large protein molecules are suspended in a gel and separated from one another by running an electric current through the gel). | No
1833 | NarrativeText | The HIV antigens are attached by blotting to a nylon or nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum is reacted against the filter, followed by treatment with developing chemi- cals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a colored patch or blot. A commercially produced Western blot test for HIV-1 is now available. It consists of a prefabricated strip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s blood serum and the developing chemicals. About nine different HIV-1 proteins can be detected in the blots. | No
1834 | NarrativeText | When used in combination with ELISA testing, Western blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however, yield false negatives in patients with very early HIV infection and in those infected by HIV-2. In some patients the Western blot yields indeterminate results. | No
1835 | NarrativeText | IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method is sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of Western blotting. An IFA test detects the presence of HIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by mix- ing HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding the blood sample, and observing the reaction under a micro- scope with ultraviolet light. | No
1836 | NarrativeText | POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test is used to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patients with false-negative ELISA and Western blot tests. These patients are sometimes called antibody-negative asympto- matic (without symptoms) carriers, because they do not have any symptoms of AIDS and there is no detectable quantity of antibody in the blood serum. Antibody-nega- tive asymptomatic carriers may be responsible for the very low ongoing risk of HIV infection transmitted by blood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 units of transfused blood. | No
1837 | NarrativeText | The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can mea- sure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the patient’s blood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV. This test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucle- ic acids in a blood sample. Numerous copies of a gene are made by separating the two strands of DNA containing the gene segment, marking its location, using DNA poly- merase to make a copy, and then continuously replicating the copies. It is questionable whether PCR will replace Western blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diag- noses. Although PCR can detect the low number of per- sons (1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generated an antibody response to the virus, the overwhelming majority of infected persons will be detected by ELISA screening within one to three months of infection. In addition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge of the genetic sequences in HIV. Since the virus is continual- ly generating new variants, PCR testing could yield a false negative in patients with these new variants. | No

1839 | NarrativeText | In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit contains multiple components, including material for specimen col- lection, a mailing envelope to send the specimen to a labo- ratory for analysis, and provides pre- and post-test coun- seling. It uses a finger prick process for blood collection. The results are obtained by the purchaser through a toll free telephone number using a personal identification number (PIN). Post test counseling is provided over the telephone by a licensed counselor. The only kit approved by the FDA as of 2001 was the Home Access test system. | No
1840 | Title | Prognostic tests | No
1841 | NarrativeText | Blood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed with HIV infection are as important as the diagnostic tests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some per- sons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or longer before they develop symptoms of AIDS. These patients are sometimes called antibody-positive asymptomatic carriers. Prognostic tests also help drug researchers eval- uate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS. | No
1842 | NarrativeText | BLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the number or proportion of certain types of cells in an AIDS patient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly the dis- ease is progressing, or whether certain treatments are helping the patient. These cell count tests include: * Complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a routine analy- sis performed on a sample of blood taken from the patient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube.

1847 | NarrativeText | CD4—A type of protein molecule in human blood that is present on the surface of 65% of human T cells. CD4 is a receptor for the HIV virus. When the HIV virus infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, it depletes the number of T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood. Most of the damage to an AIDS patient’s immune system is done by the virus’ destruction of CD4+ lympho- cytes. CD4 is sometimes called the T4 antigen. | No
1848 | NarrativeText | Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)—A diagnostic blood test used to screen patients for AIDS or other viruses. The patient’s blood is mixed with antigen attached to a plastic tube or bead sur- face. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added, and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody coupled to an enzyme is added, followed by a chemical that will cause a color reaction that can be measured by a special instrument. | No
1849 | NarrativeText | Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—A transmis- sible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Two forms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which caus- es most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and South America, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2, which is chiefly found in West African patients. HIV-2, dis- covered in 1986, appears to be less virulent than HIV- 1, but may also have a longer latency period. | No
1850 | NarrativeText | Complete blood count (CBC)—A routine analysis performed on a sample of blood taken from the patient's vein with a needle and vacuum tube. The measurements taken in a CBC include a white blood cell count, a red blood cell count, the red cell distri- bution width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume of the red blood cells to the blood volume), and the amount of hemoglobin (the blood protein that car- ries oxygen). CBCs are a routine blood test used for many medical reasons and are not used only for Immunofluorescent assay (IFA)—A blood test sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of using the Western blotting. In an IFA test, HIV anti- gen is mixed with a fluorescent compound and then with a sample of the patient’s blood. If HIV antibody is present, the mixture will fluoresce when exam- ined under ultraviolet light. | No
1851 | NarrativeText | Lymphocyte—A type of white blood cell that is important in the formation of antibodies. Doctors surements taken in a CBC include a white blood cell count (WBC), a red blood cell count (RBC), the red cell distribu- tion width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume of the red blood cells to the blood volume), and the amount of hemo- globin (the blood protein that carries oxygen). Although CBCs are used on more than just AIDS patients, they can help the doctor determine if an AIDS patient has an advanced form of the disease. Specific AIDS-related signs in a CBC include a low hematocrit, a sharp decrease in the number of blood platelets, and a low level of a certain type of white blood cell called neutrophils. | No
1852 | ListItem | ¢ Absolute CD4+ lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell that is important in the formation of an immune response. Because HIV targets CD4+ lymphocytes, their number in the patient’s blood can be used to track the course of the infection. This blood cell count is considered the most accurate indicator for the presence of an opportunistic infection in an AIDS patient. The absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count is obtained by multiplying the patient’s white blood cell count (WBC) by the percentage of lymphocytes among the white blood cells, and multiplying the result by the percentage of lymphocytes bearing the CD4+ marker. An absolute count below 200-300 CD+4 lymphocytes in 1 cubic millimeter (mm’) of blood indicates that the patient is vulnerable to some opportunistic infections. | No

1868 | ListItem | CD4+ lymphocyte percentage. Some doctors think that this is a more accurate test than the absolute count because the percentage does not depend on a manual calculation of the number of types of different white blood cells.

1871 | NarrativeText | When the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm’, the doctor will put the patient on a medication regimen to protect him or her against opportunistic infections. | No
1872 | NarrativeText | It is important for doctors treating AIDS patients to measure the lymphocyte count on a regular basis. Experts consulted by the United States Public Health Service recommend the following frequency of serum testing based on the patient’s CD4+ level: ¢ CD4+ count more than 600 cells/mm’: Every six months. | No
1873 | NarrativeText | HIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS. Another type of blood test for monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test. It sup- plements the CD4+ count, which can tell the doctor the extent of the patient’s loss of immune function, but not the speed of HIV replication in the body. The viral load test is based on PCR techniques and can measure the | No

Although rising blood levels of B,.M are found in patients with cancer and other serious diseases, a rising B.M blood level can be used to measure the progression of AIDS. | No
1877 | NarrativeText | P24 ANTIGEN CAPTURE ASSAY. Found in the viral core of HIV, p24 is a protein that can be measured by the ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays to measure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medica- tions. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful in detecting HIV infection before seroconversion. Howev- er, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of persons infected with HIV. | No
1878 | NarrativeText | GENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic testing can help determine whether specific gene muta- tions, common in people with HIV, are causing drug resistance and drug failure. The test looks for specific genetic mutations of within the virus that are known to cause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatment. For example the drug 3TC, also known as lamivudine (Epivir), is not effective against strains of HIV that have a mutation at a particular position on the reverse tran- scriptase protein—amino acid 184—known as M184V (M->V, methionine to valine). So if the genotypic resis- tance test shows a mutation at position M184V, it is like- ly that person is resistant to 3TC and not likely to respond to 3TC treatment. Genotypic tests are only effective if the person is already taking antiviral medica- tion and if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies per milliliter (mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usually between $300 and $500, is usually now covered by many insurance plans. | No
1879 | NarrativeText | PHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING. Pheno- typic testing directly measures the sensitivity of a patient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations. To do this, it measures the concentration of a drug required to inhibit viral replication in the test tube. This is the same method used by researchers to determine whether a drug might be effective against HIV before using it in human clinical trials. Phenotypic testing is a more direct measurement of resistance than genotypic testing. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic test- ing does not require a high viral load but it is recom- mended that persons already be taking antiretroviral drugs. The cost is between $700 and $900 and is now covered by many insurance plans. | No
1880 | Title | ADS serology in children | No
1881 | NarrativeText | Children born to HIV-infected mothers may acquire the infection through the mother’s placenta or during the birth process. Public health experts recommend the test- ing and monitoring of all children born to mothers with HIV. Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 months is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening con- firmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diagnosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24 antigen testing. These techniques allow a pediatrician to identify 50% of infected children at or near birth, and 95% of cases in infants three to six months of age. | No
1882 | Title | Preparation | No
1883 | NarrativeText | Preparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDS diagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to take the patient’s emotional, social, economic, and other circum- stances into account and to provide counseling before and after testing. Patients are generally better able to cope with the results if the doctor has spent some time with them before the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIV infection and testing. Many doctors now offer this type of informational counseling before performing the tests. | No
1884 | Title | Aftercare | No
1885 | NarrativeText | If the test results indicate that the patient is HIV- pos- itive, he or she will need counseling, information, referral for treatment, and support. Doctors can either counsel the patient themselves or invite an experienced HIV coun- selor to discuss the results of the blood tests with the patient. They will also assess the patient’s emotional and psychological status, including the possibility of violent behavior and the availability of a support network. | No
1886 | Title | Risks | No
1887 | NarrativeText | The risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to disclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to any physical risks connected with blood testing. Some patients are better prepared to cope with a positive diag- nosis than others, depending on their age, sex, health, resources, belief system, and similar factors. | No

1930 | NarrativeText | The alanine aminotransferase test, also known as ALT, is one of a group of tests known as liver function tests (or LFTs) and is used to monitor damage to the liver. | No
1931 | Title | Purpose | No
1932 | NarrativeText | ALT levels are used to detect liver abnormalities. Since the alanine aminotransferase enzyme is also found in muscle, tests indicating elevated AST levels might also indicate muscle damage. However, other tests, such as the levels of the MB fraction of creatine kinase should indicate whether the abnormal test levels are because of muscle or liver damage. | No
1933 | Title | Description | No
1934 | NarrativeText | The alanine aminotransferase test (ALT) can reveal liver damage. It is probably the most specific test for liver damage. However, the severity of the liver damage is not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since the amount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higher ALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or declining, ALT levels may experience serious liver damage without an increase in ALT. | No
1935 | NarrativeText | Nevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful, because ALT levels are elevated in most patients with liver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily indicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they may indicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALT levels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor- tant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example, within a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greater for AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers from alcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may be gleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results. | No

1942 | Title | Abnormal results | No
1943 | NarrativeText | Low levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L) may indicate any kind of liver disease.

1952 | NarrativeText | Albinism is an inherited condition present at birth, characterized by a lack of pigment that normally gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Many types of albinism exist, all of which involve lack of pigment in varying degrees. The condition, which is found in all races, may be accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skin cancer later in life. | No
1953 | Title | Description | No
1954 | NarrativeText | Albinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five people per 100,000 in the United States and Europe. Other parts of the world have a much higher rate; for example, albinism is found in about 20 out of every 100,000 people in southern Nigeria. | No
1955 | NarrativeText | There are 10 types of the most common form of the condition, known as “oculocutaneous albinism,” which affects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form, hair and skin remain pure white throughout life. People with a less severe form are born with white hair and skin, which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyone with oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormal flickering eye movements (nystagmus) and sensitivity to bright light. There may be other eye problems as well, including poor vision and crossed or “lazy” eyes (strabismus). | No
1956 | NarrativeText | The second most common type of the condition is known as “ocular” albinism, in which only the eyes lack color; skin and hair are normal. There are five forms of ocular albinism; some types cause more problems— especially eye problems—than others. | No

1973 | NarrativeText | Every cell in the body contains a matched pair of genes, one inherited from each parent. These genes act as a sort of “blueprint” that guides the development of a fetus. | No
1974 | NarrativeText | Albinism is an inherited problem caused by a flaw in one or more of the genes that are responsible for direct- ing the eyes and skin to make melanin (pigment). As a result, little or no pigment is made, and the child’s skin, eyes and hair may be colorless. | No
1975 | NarrativeText | carriers with one flawed gene each, they have a | in 4 chance of passing on both copies of the flawed gene to the child, who will have albinism. (There is also a type of ocular albinism that is carried on the X chromosome and occurs almost exclusively in males because they have only one X chromosome and, therefore, no other gene for the trait to override the flawed one.) | No
1976 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of albinism can involve the skin, hair, and eyes. The skin, because it contains little pigment, appears very light, as does the hair. | No
1977 | NarrativeText | In most types of albinism, a recessive trait, the child inherits flawed genes for making melanin from both par- ents. Because the task of making melanin is complex, there are many different types of albinism, involving a number of different genes. | No
1978 | NarrativeText | It’s also possible to inherit one normal gene and one albinism gene. In this case, the one normal gene provides enough information in its cellular blueprint to make some pigment, and the child will have normal skin and eye color. They “carry” one gene for albinism. About one in 70 people are albinism carriers, with one flawed gene but no symptoms; they have a 50% chance of passing the albinism gene to their child. However, if both parents are Although people with albinism may experience a vari- ety of eye problems, one of the myths about albinism is that it causes people to have pink or red eyes. In fact, people with albinism can have irises varying from light gray or blue to brown. (The iris is the colored portion of the eye that controls the size of the pupil, the opening that lets light into the eye.) If people with albinism seem to have reddish eyes, it’s because light is being reflected from the back of the eye (retina) in much the same way as happens when people are photographed with an electronic flash. | No

1983 | Title | Diagnosis | No
1984 | NarrativeText | It’s not always easy to diagnose the exact type of albinism a person has; there are two tests available that can identify only two types of the condition. Recently, a blood test has been developed that can identify carriers of the gene for some types of albinism; a similar test dur- ing amniocentesis can diagnose some types of albinism in an unborn child. A chorionic villus sampling test dur- ing the fifth week of pregnancy may also reveal some types of albinism. | No
1985 | ListItem | They may be very sensitive to light (photophobia) because their irises allow “stray” light to enter their eyes. It’s acommon misconception that people with albinism shouldn’t go out on sunny days, but wearing sunglasses can make it possible to go outside quite comfortably. | No
1986 | NarrativeText | In addition to the characteristically light skin and eye problems, people with a rare form of albinism called Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) also have a greater tendency to have bleeding disorders, inflammation of the large bowel (colitis), lung (pulmonary) disease, and kid- ney (renal) problems. | No
1987 | NarrativeText | The specific type of albinism a person has can be determined by taking a good family history and examin- ing the patient and several close relatives. | No
1988 | NarrativeText | The “hairbulb pigmentation test” is used to identify carriers by incubating a piece of the person’s hair in a solution of tyrosine, a substance in food which the body uses to make melanin. If the hair turns dark, it means the hair is making melanin (a “positive” test); light hair means there is no melanin. This test is the source of the names of two types of albinism: “ty-pos” and “‘ty-neg.” | No
1989 | NarrativeText | The tyrosinase test is more precise than the hairbulb pigmentation test. It measures the rate at which hair con- verts tyrosine into another chemical (DOPA), which is then made into pigment. The hair converts tyrosine with the help of a substance called “tyrosinase.” In some types of albinism, tyrosinase doesn’t do its job, and melanin production breaks down. | No
1990 | Title | Treatment | No
1991 | NarrativeText | There is no treatment that can replace the lack of melanin that causes the symptoms of albinism. Doctors can only treat, not cure, the eye problems that often accompany the lack of skin color. Glasses are usually needed and can be tinted to ease pain from too much sunlight. There is no cure for involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and treatments for focusing problems (surgery or contact lenses) are not effective in all cases. | No
1992 | NarrativeText | Crossed eyes (strabismus) can be treated during infancy, using eye patches, surgery or medicine injec- tions. Treatment may improve the appearance of the eye, but it can do nothing to cure the underlying con- dition. | No
1993 | NarrativeText | Patients with albinism should avoid excessive expo- sure to the sun, especially between 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. If exposure can’t be avoided, they should use UVA-UVB sunblocks with an SPF of at least 20. Taking beta- carotene may help provide some skin color, although it doesn’t protect against sun exposure. | No
1994 | Title | Prognosis | No
1995 | NarrativeText | In the United States, people with this condition can expect to have a normal lifespan. People with albinism may experience some social problems because of a lack of understanding on the part of oth- ers. When a member of a normally dark-skinned ethnic group has albinism, he or she may face some very complex social challenges. | No
1996 | NarrativeText | One of the greatest health hazards for people with albinism is excessive exposure to sun without protec- tion, which could lead to skin cancer. Wearing opaque clothes and sunscreen rated SPF 20, people with albinism can safely work and play outdoors safely even during the summer. | No

2014 | NarrativeText | Alcohol, or ethanol, is a poison with direct toxic effects on nerve and muscle cells. Depending on which nerve and muscle pathways are involved, alcohol can have far-reaching effects on different parts of the brain, peripheral nerves, and muscles, with symptoms of mem- ory loss, incoordination, seizures, weakness, and senso- ry deficits. These different effects can be grouped in three main categories: (1) intoxication due to the acute effects of ethanol, (2) withdrawal syndrome from sud- denly stopping drinking, and (3) disorders related to long-term or chronic alcohol abuse.

2018 | NarrativeText | patient with long-term alcohol abuse may have no neu- rologic complications, a single alcohol-related disease, or multiple conditions, depending on the genes they have inherited, how well nourished they are, and other environmental factors, such as exposure to other drugs or toxins. | No
2019 | NarrativeText | Neurologic complications of alcohol abuse may also result from nutritional deficiency, because alcoholics tend to eat poorly and may become depleted of thiamine or other vitamins important for nervous system function. Persons who are intoxicated are also at higher risk for head injury or for compression injuries of the peripheral nerves. Sudden changes in blood chemistry, especially sodium, related to alcohol abuse may cause central pon- tine myelinolysis, a condition of the brainstem in which nerves lose their myelin coating. Liver disease compli- cating alcoholic cirrhosis may cause dementia, deliri- um, and movement disorder. | No
2020 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
2021 | NarrativeText | When a person drinks alcohol, it is absorbed by blood vessels in the stomach lining and flows rapidly throughout the body and brain, as ethanol freely crosses the blood-brain barrier that ordinarily keeps large mole- cules from escaping from the blood vessel to the brain tissue. Drunkenness, or intoxication, may occur at blood ethanol concentrations of as low as 50-150 mg per dL in people who don’t drink. Sleepiness, stupor, coma, or even death from respiratory depression and low blood pressure occur at progressively higher concentrations. | No
2022 | NarrativeText | Although alcohol is broken down by the liver, the toxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most likely a direct result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdown products. The fatal dose varies widely because people who drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol with repeated use. In addition, alcohol tolerance results in the need for higher levels of blood alcohol to achieve intoxicating effects, which increases the likeli- hood that habitual drinkers will be exposed to high and potentially toxic levels of ethanol. This is particularly true when binge drinkers fail to eat, because fasting decreases the rate of alcohol clearance and causes even higher blood alcohol levels. | No
2023 | NarrativeText | When a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, withdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of increased excitability of the central nervous system, called deliri- um tremens or “DTs.” Symptoms begin six to eight hours after abstinence, and are most pronounced 24-72 hours after abstinence. They include body shaking (tremulousness), insomnia, agitation, confusion, hear- ing voices or seeing images that are not really there (such as crawling bugs), seizures, rapid heart beat, pro- fuse sweating, high blood pressure, and fever. Alcohol- related seizures may also occur without withdrawal, such as during active heavy drinking or after more than a week without alcohol. | No
2024 | NarrativeText | Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by defi- ciency of the B-vitamin thiamine, and can also be seen in people who don’t drink but have some other cause of thi- amine deficiency, such as chronic vomiting that prevents the absorption of this vitamin. Patients with this condi- tion have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathy; the symptoms include marked confusion, delirium, dis- orientation, inattention, memory loss, and drowsiness. Examination reveals abnormalities of eye movement, including jerking of the eyes (nystagmus) and double vision. Problems with balance make walking difficult. People may have trouble coordinating their leg move- ments, but usually not their arms. If thiamine is not given promptly, Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stu- por, coma, and death. | No
2025 | NarrativeText | If thiamine is given and death averted, Korsakoff’s syndrome may develop in some patients, who suffer from memory impairment that leaves them unable to remember events for a period of a few years before the onset of illness (retrograde amnesia) and unable to learn new information (anterograde amnesia). Most patients have very limited insight into their memory dysfunction and have a tendency to make up explanations for events they have forgotten (confabulation). | No
2026 | NarrativeText | Severe alcoholism can cause cerebellar degenera- tion, a slowly progressive condition affecting portions of the brain called the anterior and superior cerebellar ver- mis, causing a wide-based gait, leg incoordination, and an inability to walk heel-to-toe in tightrope fashion. The gait disturbance usually develops over several weeks, but may be relatively mild for some time, and then suddenly worsen after binge drinking or an unrelated illness. | No
2027 | NarrativeText | Fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in infants born to alcoholic mothers when prenatal exposure to ethanol retards fetal growth and development. Affected infants often have a distinctive appearance with a thin upper lip, flat nose and mid-face, short stature and small head size. Almost half are mentally retarded, and most others are mildly impaired intellectually or have problems with speech, learning, and behavior. | No
2028 | NarrativeText | Alcoholic myopathy, or weakness secondary to breakdown of muscle tissue, is also known as alcoholic rhabdomyolysis or alcoholic myoglobinuria. Males are affected by acute (sudden onset) alcoholic myopathy four times as often as females. Breakdown of muscle tis- sue (myonecrosis), can come on suddenly during binge drinking or in the first days of alcohol withdrawal. In its mildest form, this breakdown may cause no noticeable symptoms, but may be detected by a temporary elevation in blood levels of an enzyme found predominantly in muscle, the MM fraction of creatine kinase. | No
2029 | NarrativeText | The severe form of acute alcoholic myopathy is associated with the sudden onset of muscle pain, swelling, and weakness; a reddish tinge in the urine caused by myoglobin, a breakdown product of muscle excreted in the urine; and a rapid rise in muscle enzymes in the blood. Symptoms usually worsen over hours to a few days, and then improve over the next week to 10 days as the patient is withdrawn from alcohol. Muscle symptoms are usually generalized, but pain and swelling may selectively involve the calves or other muscle groups. The muscle breakdown of acute alcoholic myopathy may be worsened by crush injuries, which may occur when people drink so much that they com- press a muscle group with their body weight for a long time without moving, or by withdrawal seizures with generalized muscle activity. | No
2030 | NarrativeText | In patients who abuse alcohol over many years, chronic alcoholic myopathy may develop. Males and females are equally affected. Symptoms include pain- less weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunk and the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips, shoulders, and upper arms. This weakness develops gradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms of acute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased bulk, may be striking. The nerves of the extremities may also begin to break down, a condition known as alcoholic peripheral neuropathy, which can add to the person’s difficulty in moving. | No
2031 | NarrativeText | The way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is still not well understood. Proposed mechanisms include muscle membrane changes affecting the transport of cal- cium, potassium, or other minerals; impaired muscle energy metabolism; and impaired protein synthesis. Alcohol is metabolized or broken down primarily by the liver, with a series of chemical reactions in which ethanol is converted to acetate. Acetate is metabolized by skeletal muscle, and alcohol-related changes in liver function may affect skeletal muscle metabolism, decreasing the amount of blood sugar available to muscles during pro- longed activity. Because not enough sugar is available to supply needed energy, muscle protein may be broken down as an alternate energy source. However, toxic effects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdown products. | No
2032 | NarrativeText | Although alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may con- tribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring the motor nerves controlling muscle movement, alcoholic neuropathy more commonly affects sensory fibers. Injury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning pain in the feet, which may be severe enough to interfere with walking. As the condition worsens, pain decreases but numbness increases. | No
2033 | Title | Diagnosis | No
2034 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic disease depends largely on finding characteristic symptoms and signs in patients who abuse alcohol. Other possible causes should be excluded by the appropriate tests, which may include blood chemistry, thyroid function tests, brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography scan), and/or cerebrospinal fluid analysis. | No
2035 | NarrativeText | Acute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed by inding myoglobin in the urine and increased creatine kinase and other blood enzymes released from injured muscle. The surgical removal of a small piece of muscle or microscopic analysis (muscle biopsy) shows the scattered breakdown and repair of muscle fibers. Doc- tors must rule out other acquired causes of muscle breakdown, which include the abuse of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, or amphetamines; trauma with crush injury; the depletion of phosphate or potassium; or an underlying defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates or ipids. In chronic alcoholic myopathy, serum creatine kinase often is normal, and muscle biopsy shows atro- phy, or loss of muscle fibers. Electromyography (EMG) may show features characteristic of alcoholic myopathy or neuropathy. | No
2036 | Title | Treatment | No
2037 | NarrativeText | Acute management of alcohol intoxication, delirium tremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive, to mon- itor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory failure that may develop. In delirium tremens, fever and sweat- ing may necessitate treatment of fluid loss and secondary low blood pressure. Agitation may be treated with ben- zodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide, beta-adrenergic antagonists such as atenolol, or alpha 2-adrenergic ago- nists such as clonidine. Because Wernicke’s syndrome is rapidly reversible with thiamine, and because death may intervene if thiamine is not given promptly, all patients admitted for acute complications of alcohol, as well as all patients with unexplained encephalopathy, should be given intravenous thiamine. | No
2038 | NarrativeText | Withdrawal seizures typically resolve without spe- cific anti-epileptic drug treatment, although status epilep- ticus (continual seizures occurring without interruption) should be treated vigorously.

2054 | NarrativeText | Chronic alcoholic myopathy and other chronic con- ditions are treated by correcting associated nutritional deficiencies and maintaining a diet adequate in protein and carbohydrate. The key to treating any alcohol-related disease is helping the patient overcome alcohol addic- tion. Behavioral measures and social supports may be needed in patients who develop broad problems in their thinking abilities (dementia) or remain in a state of con- fusion and disorientation (delirium). People with walk- ing disturbances may benefit from physical therapy and assistive devices. Doctors may also prescribe drugs to treat the pain associated with peripheral neuropathy. | No
2055 | Title | Prognosis | No
2056 | NarrativeText | Complete recovery from Wernicke’s syndrome may follow prompt administration of thiamine. However, repeated episodes of encephalopathy or prolonged alco- hol abuse may cause persistent dementia or Korsakoff psychosis. Most patients recover fully from acute alco- holic myopathy within days to weeks, but severe cases may be fatal from acute kidney failure and disturbances in heart rhythm secondary to increased potassium levels. Recovery from chronic alcoholic myopathy may occur over weeks to months of abstinence from alcohol and correction of malnutrition. Cerebellar degeneration and alcoholic neuropathy may also improve to some extent with abstinence and balanced diet, depending on the severity and duration of the condition. | No
2057 | Title | Prevention | No
2058 | NarrativeText | Prevention requires abstinence from alcohol. Per- sons who consume small or moderate amounts of alcohol might theoretically help prevent nutritional complica- tions of alcohol use with dietary supplements including B vitamins. However, proper nutrition cannot protect against the direct toxic effect of alcohol or of its break- down products. Patients with any alcohol-related symp- toms or conditions, pregnant women, and patients with liver or neurologic disease should abstain completely. Persons with family history of alcoholism or alcohol- related conditions may also be at increased risk for neu- rologic complications of alcohol use. | No

2073 | NarrativeText | The essential feature of alcohol abuse is the mal- adaptive use of alcohol with recurrent and significant adverse consequences related to its repeated use. Alco- holism is the popular term for two disorders, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. The hallmarks of both these disorders involve repeated life problems that can be directly attributed to the use of alcohol. Both these disor- ders can have serious consequences, affecting an individ- ual’s health and personal life, as well as having an impact on society at large. | No
2074 | Title | Description | No
2075 | NarrativeText | The effects of alcoholism are quite far-reaching. Alcohol affects every body system, causing a wide range of health problems. Some such problems include poor nutrition, memory disorders, difficulty with balance and walking, liver disease (including cirrhosis and hepatitis), high blood pressure, muscle weakness (including the heart), heart rhythm disturbances, anemia, clotting disor- ders, decreased immunity to infections, gastrointestinal inflammation and irritation, acute and chronic problems with the pancreas, low blood sugar, high blood fat con- tent, interference with reproductive fertility, and weak- ened bones. | No
2076 | NarrativeText | On a personal level, alcoholism results in marital and other relationship difficulties, depression, unemploy- ment, child abuse, and general family dysfunction. | No
2077 | NarrativeText | Alcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of severe social problems inc suicide, injury, and violent uding homelessness, murder, crime. Alcohol is a contribut- ing factor in at least 50% of all deaths from motor vehi- cle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths occur each year due to the effects of a cohol, of which 50% are due to injuries of some sort. According to a recent special report prepared for the U. S. Congress by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the impact of alcohol on society, inc uding violence, traffic acci- dents, lost work productivity, and premature death, costs our nation an estimated $185 billion annually. In addi- tion, it is estimated that ap, dren (19 million children o 17 years of age) is exposed proximately one in four chil- r 29 percent of children up to at some time to familial alco- hol abuse, alcohol dependence, or both. Furthermore, it has been estimated that approximately 18 percent of adults experience an episode of alcohol abuse or depen- dence a some time during their lives. | No
2078 | Title | Causes and sympto! ms | No
2079 | NarrativeText | There are probably a number of factors that work together to cause a person to become an alcoholic. Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that close rel- atives of an alcoholic are four times more likely to become alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this risk holds true even for children who were adopted away from their biological fam non-alcoholic adoptive fa ilies at birth and raised in a mily, with no knowledge of their biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. More research is being conducted to determine if genetic fac- tors could account for diff lism that may increase the ing an alcoholic. ferences in alcohol metabo- risk of an individual becom- The symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down into two major categories: symptoms of acute alcohol use and symptoms of long-term alcohol use. | No
2080 | Title | mmediate (acute) effects of alcohol use | No
2081 | NarrativeText | Alcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. The blood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from enter- ing the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quickly become equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol’s depressive effects result in ance, slurring of speech, an difficulty walking, poor bal- id generally poor coordination (accounting in part for the increased likelihood of injury). The affected person may also have impairment of periperal vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’s breathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomiting may occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathed into the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including the possibility of pneumonia). Still higher alcohol levels may result in coma and death. | No
2082 | Title | Effects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism | No
2083 | NarrativeText | Long-term use of alcohol affects virtually every organ system of the body: ¢ Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men in their teens and twenties have experienced alcoholic blackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantity of alcohol results in the loss of memory of the time surrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is well- known to cause sleep disturbances, so that overall sleep quality is affected. Numbness and tingling may occur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes, which can occur together or separately, are known as Wernicke’s and Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to the low thiamine (a form of vitamin B complex) levels found in alcoholics. Wernicke’s syndrome results in disor- dered eye movements, very poor balance and difficulty walking, while Korsakoff’s syndrome severely affects one’s memory, preventing new learning from taking place. | No
2084 | ListItem | Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of the muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contents from re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the acid from the stomach flows backwards into the esopha- gus, burning those tissues, and causing pain and bleeding. Inflammation of the stomach can also result in bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to eat. A major cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding (hem- orrhage) in an alcoholic is the development of enlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the esophagus, which are called esophageal varices. These varices are actually developed in response to liver disease, and are extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhaging. Diarrhea is a common symptom, due to alcohol’s effect on the pancreas. In addition, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) is a serious and painful problem in alcoholics. Throughout the intestinal tract, alcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrients, creating a malnourished state. Because alcohol is bro- ken down (metabolized) within the liver, that organ is severely affected by constant levels of alcohol. Alco- hol interferes with a number of important chemical processes that also occur in the liver. The liver begins to enlarge and fill with fat (fatty liver), fibrous scar | No

2087 | ListItem | Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of blood cells. Red blood cells become abnormally large. White blood cells (important for fighting infec- tions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakened immune system. This places alcoholics at increased risk for infections, and is thought to account in part for the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics (ten times increased over normal). Platelets and blood clotting factors are affected, causing an increased risk of bleeding. | No
2088 | ListItem | Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in blood pressure, but with increased use, alcohol begins to increase blood pressure into a dangerous range. High levels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase the risk of heart disease. Heavy drinking results in an increase in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle, abnormal heart rhythms, a risk of blood clots forming within the chambers of the heart, and a greatly increased risk of stroke (due to a blood clot from the heart entering the circulatory system, going to the brain, and blocking a brain blood vessel). | No
2089 | ListItem | Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negative effect on fertility in both men and women, by decreas- ing testicle and ovary size, and interfering with both sperm and egg production. When pregnancy is achieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby has a great risk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome, which causes distinctive facial defects, lowered IQ, and behavioral problems. | No
2090 | Title | Diagnosis | No
2091 | NarrativeText | Two different types of alcohol-related difficulties have been identified. The first is called alcohol depen- dence, which refers to a person who literally depends on the use of alcohol. Three of the following traits must be present to diagnose alcohol dependence: * tolerance, meaning that a person becomes accustomed to a particular dose of alcohol, and must increase the dose in order to obtain the desired effect * withdrawal, meaning that a person experiences unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms when he or she does not drink alcohol | No

2099 | NarrativeText | Other, longer lists of questions exist to help deter- mine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.

2102 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis is sometimes brought about when family members call an alcoholic’s difficulties to the attention of a physician. A clinician may begin to be suspicious when a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins to experience medical problems related to the use of alco- hol. In fact, some estimates suggest that about 20% of a physician’s patients will be alcoholics. | No
2103 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho- logical assessments that try to determine what aspects of a person’s life may be affected by his or her use of alco- hol. Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a per- son drinks is of much less importance than determining how his or her drinking affects relationships, jobs, educa- tional goals, and family life. In fact, because the metabo- lism of alcohol (how the body breaks down and process- es alcohol) is so individual, the quantity of alcohol con- sumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing either alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse. | No
2104 | NarrativeText | One very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of alcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consists of four questions, with the first letters of each key word spelling out the word CAGE: « Have you ever tried to Cut down on your drinking? | No
2105 | ListItem | ¢ Have you ever been Annoyed by anyone’s comments about your drinking? | No
2106 | NarrativeText | Physical examination may reveal signs suggestive of alcoholism: evidence of old injuries; a visible network of enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel (called caput medusae); fluid in the abdomen (ascites); yellowish-tone to the skin; decreased testicular size in men; and poor nutritional status. Lab work may reveal an increase in the size of the red blood cells; abnormalities in the white blood cells (cells responsible for fighting infection) and platelets (particles responsible for clot- ting); and an increase in certain liver enzymes. | No
2107 | Title | Treatment | No
2108 | NarrativeText | Treatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first step in the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification, involves helping the person stop drinking and ridding his or her body of the harmful (toxic) effects of alcohol. Because the person’s body has become accustomed to alcohol, the person will need to be supported through withdrawal. Withdrawal will be different for different patients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, as measured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and the length of time the patient has been an alcoholic. With- drawal symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening. Mild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diar- rhea, difficulty sleeping, sweatiness, anxiety, and trem- bling. This phase is usually over in about three to five days. More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu- cinations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some- thing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearable craving for more alcohol, confusion, fever, fast heart rate, high blood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating level of consciousness). Patients at highest risk for the most severe symptoms of withdrawal (referred to as delirium tremens) are those with other medical problems, including malnu- trition, liver disease, or Wernicke’s syndrome. Delirium * Have you ever felt Gui/ty about your drinking? | No
2109 | NarrativeText | tremens usually begin about three to five days after the patient’s last drink, progressing from the more mild symp- toms to the more severe, and may last a number of days. | No
2110 | NarrativeText | Patients going through only mild withdrawal are sim- ply monitored carefully to make sure that more severe symptoms do not develop. No medications are necessary, however. Treatment of a patient suffering the more severe effects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative med- ications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and to avoid the potentially life-threatening complications of high blood pressure, fast heart rate, and seizures. Drugs called benzodiazapines are helpful in those patients suffering from hallucinations. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluids may need to be given through a vein (intravenously), along with some necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thi- amine be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usually quite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamine is responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. | No
2111 | NarrativeText | After cessation of drinking has been accomplished, the next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever tak- ing another drink. This phase of treatment is referred to as rehabilitation. The best programs incorporate the family into the therapy, because the family has undoubt- edly been severely affected by the patient’s drinking. Some therapists believe that family members, in an effort to deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, some- times develop patterns of behavior that accidentally sup- port or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation is referred to as ““co-dependence,” and must be addressed in order to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism. | No
2112 | NarrativeText | Sessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics meet regularly and provide support for each other’s recoveries, are considered some of the best methods of preventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps the most well-known such group is called Alcoholics Anonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help peo- ple avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing the destructive power that alcohol has held over the alco- holic’s life, looking to a higher power for help in over- coming the problem, and reflecting on the ways in which the use of alcohol has hurt others and, if possi- ble, making amends to those people. According to a recent study reported by the American Psychological Association (APA), anyone, regardless of his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefit from participation in 12-step programs such as Alco- holics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groups exceeds the number of visits to all mental health profes- sionals combined. | No

Naltrexone, along with a similar compound, Nalmefene, can be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acam- prosate is helpful in preventing relapse. None of these medications would be helpful unless the patient was also willing to work very hard to change his or her behavior. | No
2116 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
2117 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for the alcoholic patient, once the medical danger of withdrawal has passed. Because many alcoholics have very stressful lives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism is sometimes a matter of debate), many of the treatments for alcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress. These include massage, meditation, and hypnotherapy. The malnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri- tion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to a healthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such as vitamins A, B complex, and C, as well as certain fatty acids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbal treatments include milk thistle(Si/ybum marianum), which is thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbs are thought to be helpful for the patient suffering through withdrawal. Some of these include lavender (Lavandula officinalis), skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora), chamomile (Matricaria recutita), peppermint (Mentha piperita) yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and valerian (Valeriana officinalis).

2119 | NarrativeText | Recovery from alcoholism is a life-long process. In fact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are encour- aged to refer to themselves ever after as “a recovering alco- holic,” never a recovered alcoholic. This is because most researchers in the field believe that since the potential for alcoholism is still part of the individual’s biological and psychological makeup, one can never fully recover from alcoholism. The potential for relapse (returning to illness) is always there, and must be acknowledged and respected. Statistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics in stable financial and family situations who have undergone treatment, 60% or more can be successful at an attempt to stop drinking for at least a year, and many for a lifetime. | No

It is particularly important that teenagers who are at high risk for alco- holism—those with a family history of alcoholism, an early or frequent use of alcohol, a tendency to drink to drunkenness, alcohol use that interferes with school work, a poor family environment, or a history of domes- tic violence—receive education about alcohol and its long-term effects. How this is best achieved, without irri- tating the youngsters and thus losing their attention, is the subject of continuing debate and study. | No

2145 | NarrativeText | Aldolase is an enzyme found throughout the body, particularly in muscles. Like all enzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase helps mus- cle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldolase is done to diagnose and monitor skeletal muscle diseases. | No
2146 | Title | Purpose | No
2147 | NarrativeText | Skeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level found in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are those muscles attached to bones and whose contractions make those bones move. When the muscles are diseased or damaged, such as in muscular dystrophy, the cells dete- riorate and break open. The contents of the cells, includ- ing aldolase, spill into the bloodstream. Measuring the amount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree of muscle damage. | No
2148 | NarrativeText | As muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels decrease and eventually fall below normal. Less muscle means fewer cells and less aldolase. | No
2149 | NarrativeText | Muscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as well as muscular problems. The measurement of aldolase levels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase levels will be normal where muscle weakness is caused by neurologi- cal disease, such as poliomyelitis or multiple sclerosis, but aldolase levels will be elevated in cases of muscular disease, such as muscular dystrophy. | No
2150 | Title | 99 | No
2151 | NarrativeText | Aldolase is also found in the liver and cardiac mus- cle of the heart. Damage or disease to these organs, such as chronic hepatitis or a heart attack, will also increase aldolase levels in the blood, but to a lesser degree. | No
2152 | Title | Description | No
2153 | NarrativeText | Aldolase is measured by mixing a person’s serum with a substance with which aldolase is known to trigger a reaction. The end product of this reaction is measured, and, from that measurement, the amount of aldolase in the person’s serum is determined. | No
2154 | NarrativeText | The test is covered by insurance when medically necessary. Results are usually available the next day. | No
2155 | Title | Preparation | No
2156 | NarrativeText | To collect the 5-10 ml of blood needed for this test, a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the patient’s upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the needle into an attached tube. Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes. | No
2157 | NarrativeText | The patient should avoid strenuous exercise and have nothing to eat or drink, except water, for eight to ten hours before this test. | No
2158 | Title | Aftercare | No
2159 | NarrativeText | Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort. | No
2160 | Title | Normal results | No
2161 | NarrativeText | Newborns have the highest normal aldolase levels and adults the lowest. Normal values will vary based on the laboratory and the method used. | No
2162 | Title | Abnormal results | No
2163 | NarrativeText | As noted, aldolase is elevated in skeletal muscle dis- eases, such as muscular dystrophies. Duchenne’s muscu- lar dystrophy, the most common type of muscular dystro- phy, will increase the aldolase level more than any other disease. | No
2164 | NarrativeText | Nondisease conditions that affect the muscle, such as injury, gangrene, or an infection, can also increase the aldolase level. Also, strenuous exercise can temporarily increase a person’s aldolase level. | No

2179 | NarrativeText | This test measures the levels of aldosterone, a hor- mone produced by the outer part (cortex) of the two adrenal glands, organs which sit one on top of each of the kidneys. Aldosterone regulates the amounts of sodi- um and potassium in the blood. This helps maintain water balance and blood volume, which, in turn, affects blood pressure. | No
2180 | Title | Purpose | No
2181 | NarrativeText | Aldosterone measurement is useful in detecting a condition called aldosteronism, which is caused by excess secretion of the hormone from the adrenal glands. | No
2182 | NarrativeText | There are two types of aldosteronism: primary and sec- ondary. Primary aldosteronism is most commonly caused by an adrenal tumor, as in Conn’s syndrome. Idiopathic (of unknown cause) hyperaldosteronism is another type of primary aldosteronism. Secondary aldosteronism is more common and may occur with congestive heart fail- ure, cirrhosis with fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium, sodium-depleted diet, and toxemia of pregnancy. | No
2183 | NarrativeText | To differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec- ondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be per- formed at the same time as the aldosterone assay. Renin, an enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in secondary aldosteronism and low in primary aldosteronism. | No
2184 | Title | Description | No
2185 | NarrativeText | Aldosterone testing can be performed on a blood sample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several factors, including diet, posture (upright or lying down), and time of day that the sample is obtained can cause aldosterone levels to fluctuate. Blood samples are affected by short- term fluctuations. A urine specimen collected over an entire 24-hour period lessens the effects of those inter- fering factors and provides a more reliable aldosterone measurement. | No
2186 | Title | Preparation | No
2187 | NarrativeText | Fasting is not required for either the blood sample or urine collection, but the patient should maintain a nor- mal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3 g] /day) for at least two weeks before either test. The doctor should decide if drugs that alter sodium, potassium, and fluid balance (e.g., diuretics, antihypertensives, steroids, oral contraceptives) should be withheld. The test will be more accurate if these are suspended at least two weeks before the test. Renin inhibitors (e.g., propranolol) should not be taken one week before the test, unless per- mitted by the physician. The patient should avoid licorice for at least two weeks before the test, because of its aldosterone-like effect. Strenuous exercise and stress can increase aldosterone levels as well. Because the test is usually performed by a method called radioimmunoas- say, recently administered radioactive medications will affect test results. | No
2188 | NarrativeText | Since posture and body position affect aldosterone, hospitalized patients should remain in an upright position (at least sitting) for two hours before blood is drawn. Occasionally blood will be drawn again before the patient gets out of bed. Nonhospitalized patients should arrive at the laboratory in time to maintain an upright position for at least two hours. | No

Among other condi- tions, elevated levels are also seen in secondary aldos- teronism, stress, and malignant hypertension. | No
2200 | NarrativeText | Decreased levels of aldosterone are found in aldos- terone deficiency, steroid therapy, high-sodium diets, certain antihypertensive therapies, and Addison’s dis- ease (an autoimmune disorder). | No

2208 | NarrativeText | Alemtuzumab is sold as Campath in the United States. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti- body that selectively binds to CD52, a protein found on the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells, that is used to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cells of patients who have B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). | No
2209 | Title | Purpose | No
2210 | NarrativeText | Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat B-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronic leukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein found on the surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immune system. By binding the CD52 protein on the malignant B cells, the antibody targets it for removal from the circula- tion. Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers anti- body-mediated lysis of the B cells, a method that the immune system uses to eliminate foreign cells. | No
2211 | NarrativeText | Alemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for treatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease to be classified as refractory, both alkylating agents and flu- darabine treatment must have been tried and failed. Thus, this drug gives patients who have tried all approved treat- ments for B-CLL another option. As most patients with B-CLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylating agents and fludarabine have been tried, the experience with alemtuzumab treatment are primarily with those stages of the disease. In clinical trials, about 30% of patients had a partial response to the drug, with 2% of these being complete responses. | No
2212 | NarrativeText | This antibody has been tested with limited success in the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and for the preparation of patients with various immune cell malignancies for bone marrow transplantation. There is also a clinical trial ongoing to test the ability of this anti- body to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation. | No

Like all antibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one partic- ular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal antibody. For alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a protein found on the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells as well as other cells of the immune and male reproductive systems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, mean- ing that the regions that bind CD52, located on the tips of | No
2215 | Title | 102 | No
2216 | NarrativeText | the Y branches, are derived from rat antibodies, but the rest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence of the human sequences helps to reduce the immune response by the patient against the antibody itself, a problem seen when complete mouse antibodies are used for cancer therapies. The human sequences also help to ensure that the various cell-destroying mechanisms of the human immune system are properly triggered with binding of the antibody. | No
2217 | NarrativeText | Alemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the treatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for use alone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the anti- body to be used in combination with the purine analogs pentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen, another protein found on the surface of B cells. | No
2218 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
2219 | NarrativeText | This antibody should be administered in a gradually escalating pattern at the start of treatment and any time administration is interrupted for seven or more days. The recommended beginning dosage for B-CLL patients is a daily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two- hour IV infusion. Once this amount is tolerated, the dose is increased to 10 mg per day. After tolerating this dose, it can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days a week. Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydro- choride are given thirty to sixty minutes before the infu- sion to help reduce side effects. | No
2220 | NarrativeText | Additionally, patients generally receive anti-infec- tive medication before treatment to help minimize the serious opportunistic infections that can result from this treatment. Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to pre- vent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial to decrease infections, although they were not eliminated. | No
2221 | Title | Precautions | No
2222 | NarrativeText | Blood studies should be done on a weekly basis while patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treat- ment. Vaccination during the treatment session is not recommended, given the T cell depletion that occurs during treatment. Furthermore, given that antibodies like alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to the developing fetus and in breast milk, use during preg- nancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unless clearly needed. | No

2231 | NarrativeText | Tumor lysis syndrome—A side effect of some immunotherapies, like monoclonal antibodies, that lyse the tumor cells, due to the toxicity of flooding the bloodstream with such a quantity of cellular contents. | No
2232 | NarrativeText | Because CD52 is expressed on a patient’s normal B and T cells, as well as on the surface of the abnormal B cells, the treatment eliminates both normal and cancerous cells. The treatment also seems to trigger autoimmune reactions against various other blood cells. This results in severe reduction of the many circulating blood cells including red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells (neutropenia), and clotting cells (thrombopenia). These conditions are treated with blood transfusions. The great majority of patients treated exhibit some type of blood cell depletion. | No
2233 | NarrativeText | A second serious side effect of this drug is the preva- lence of opportunistic infections that occurs during the treatment. Serious, and sometimes fatal bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan infections have been reported. Treatments to prevent pneumonia and herpes infections reduce, but do not eliminate these infections. | No
2234 | NarrativeText | The majority of other side effects occur after or dur- ing the first infusion of the drug. Some common side effects of this drug include fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, skin rash, and unusual fatigue. This drug can also cause low blood pres- sure (hypotension). | No
2235 | NarrativeText | In patients with high tumor burden (a large number of circulating malignant B cells) this drug can cause a side effect called tumor lysis syndrome. Thought to be due to the release of the lysed cells’ contents into the blood stream, it can cause a misbalance of urea, uric acid, phosphate, potassium, and calcium in the urine and blood. Patients at risk for this side effect must keep hydrated and can be given allopurinol before infusion. anbiuypa} | No

2242 | NarrativeText | The Alexander technique is a somatic method for improving physical and mental functioning. Excessive tension, which Frederick Alexander, the originator, rec- ognized as both physical and mental, restricts movement and creates pressure in the joints, the spine, the breathing mechanism, and other organs. The goal of the technique is to restore freedom and expression to the body and clear thinking to the mind. | No
2243 | Title | Purpose | No
2244 | NarrativeText | Because the Alexander technique helps students improve overall functioning, both mental and physical, it offers a wide range of benefits. Nikolaas Tinbergen, in his 1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the “striking improvements in such diverse things as high blood pressure, breathing, depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and mental alertness, resilience against outside pressures, and the refined skill of playing a musical instrument.” He went on to quote a list of other conditions helped by the Alexander tech- nique: “rheumatism, including various forms of arthritis, then respiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal asth- ma; following in their wake, circulation defects, which may lead to high blood pressure and also to some danger- ous heart conditions; gastrointestinal disorders of many types, various gynecological conditions, sexual failures, migraines and depressive states.” | No
2245 | NarrativeText | Literature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to include improvements in back pain, chronic pain, postural prob- lems, repetitive strain injury, benefits during pregnancy and childbirth, help in applying physical therapy and rehabilitative exercises, improvements in strain caused by computer use, improvements in the posture and perfor- mance of school children, and improvements in vocal and dramatic performance among the benefits offered by the technique. | No
2246 | Title | Description | No
2247 | Title | Origins | No
2248 | NarrativeText | Frederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 in Tasmania, Australia. He became an actor and Shake- spearean reciter, and early in his career he began to suffer from strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical atten- tion for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with a recommended prescription and extensive periods of rest, his problem persisted. | No
2249 | NarrativeText | Alexander realized that his hoarseness began about an hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that it was something he did in the process of reciting that caused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medical octor, Alexander told him of his observation. When the loctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander was joing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to try and find out for himself. | No
2250 | NarrativeText | Thus began a decade of self-observation and discov- ery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in the act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing, walking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve his coordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One of his most startling discoveries was that in order to change the way he used his body he had to change the way he was thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way that he did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt- ed speech or movement. After making this discovery at the end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became a pioneer in body-mind medicine. | No
2251 | NarrativeText | At first, performers and dancers sought guidance from Alexander to overcome physical complaints and to improve the expression and spontaneity of their performances. Soon a great number of people sought help from his teaching for a variety of physical and mental disorders. | No
2252 | NarrativeText | The Alexander technique is primarily taught one- on-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops or workshops for special applications of the technique (e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common. Pri- vate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length, and are taught in a series. The number of lessons varies according to the severity of the student’s difficulties with coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter- est in pursuing the improvements made possible by con- tinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80 per hour. Insurance coverage is not widely available, but discounts are available for participants in some comple- mentary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible Spending Accounts for health care cover Alexander technique lessons if they are prescribed by a physician. | No
2253 | NarrativeText | In lessons teachers guide students through simple movements (while students are dressed in comfortable clothing) and use their hands to help students identify and stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arises from mental processes as well as physical, so discussions of personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in the course of a lesson. | No
2254 | NarrativeText | The technique helps students move with ease and improved coordination. At the beginning of a move- ment (the lessons are a series of movements), most people pull back their heads, raise their shoulders toward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tighten their legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension in their bodies. Alexander referred to this as misuse of the body. | No
2255 | NarrativeText | At any point in a movement, proper use can be established. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, the head will carry slightly forward of the spine, simply because it is heavier in the front. When the head is out of balance in the forward direction, it sets off a series of stretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It is skillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex activity in the feet and legs, the arms and hands, the breathing mechanism, and other parts of the body, that lessons in the technique aim to develop. | No
2256 | NarrativeText | Alexander found that optimal functioning of the body was very hard to maintain, even for the short period of time it took to complete a single movement. People, especially adults, have very strong tension habits associ- ated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles is common. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele- visions or video monitors, too much sitting or driving and too little walking, or by tension associated with past traumas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after a whiplash injury or favoring a broken or sprained leg long after it has healed are examples of habitual tension caused by injury. | No
2257 | NarrativeText | The first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech- nique does is to increase a student’s sensory awareness of this excessive habitual tension, particularly that in the neck and spine. Next the student is taught to inhibit the tension. If the student prepares to sit down, for example, he will tense his muscles in his habitual way. If he is asked to put aside the intention to sit and instead to free his neck and allow less constriction in his muscles, he can begin to change his tense habitual response to sitting. | No
2258 | NarrativeText | By leaving the head resting on the spine in its natur- al free balance, by keeping eyes open and focused, not held in a tense stare, by allowing the shoulders to release, the knees to unlock and the back to lengthen and widen, a student greatly reduces strain. In Alexander lessons stu- dents learn to direct themselves this way in activity and become skilled in fluid, coordinated movement. | No
2259 | Title | Precautions | No
2260 | Title | Side effects | No
2261 | NarrativeText | The focus of the Alexander technique is educational. Teachers use their hands simply to gently guide students in movement. Therefore, both contraindications and potential physiological side effects are kept to a mini- mum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony struc- ture is attempted, so damage to tissues, even in the case of errors in teaching, is unlikely. | No
2262 | NarrativeText | As students’ sensory awareness develops in the course of Alexander lessons, they become more acutely aware of chronic tension patterns. As students learn to release excessive tension in their muscles and to sustain this release in daily activity, they may experience tight- ness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is caused by the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened and released muscles and the expanded range of movement in the joints. | No
2263 | NarrativeText | Occasionally students may get light-headed during a lesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu- latory or respiratory functioning. | No
2264 | NarrativeText | Forceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures often indicate suppression of emotion. As muscles release during or after an Alexander lesson, students may experience strong surges of emotion or sudden changes in mood.

2292 | NarrativeText | Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found through- out the body. Like all enzymes, it is needed, in small amounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When it is present in large amounts, it may signify bone or liver disease or a tumor. | No
2293 | Title | Purpose | No
2294 | NarrativeText | Medical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned with the enzyme that is found in liver, bone, placenta, and intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkaline phosphate and other substances is continually drained away through the bile duct. In a diseased liver, this bile duct is often blocked, keeping fluid within the liver. Alkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventually escapes into the bloodstream. | No
2295 | NarrativeText | The alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by the cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver. Its origin differs from that of other enzymes called aminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of an obstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the biliary drainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will be the first and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the other hand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells (hepato- cytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently.Thus, these enzymes are very useful in distinguishing the type of liver disease—cholestatic or hepatocellular. | No

2299 | NarrativeText | During pregnancy, alkaline phosphatase is made by the placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream. This is normal. Some tumors, however, start production of the same kind of alkaline phosphatase produced by the placenta. These tumors are called germ cell tumors and include testicular cancer and certain brain tumors. | No
2300 | NarrativeText | Alkaline phosphatase from the intestine is increased in a person with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis. | No
2301 | Title | Description | No
2302 | NarrativeText | Alkaline phosphatase is measured by combining the person’s serum with specific substances with which alka- line phosphatase is known to react. The end product of this reaction is measured; and from that measurement, the amount of alkaline phosphatase in the person’s serum is determined. | No
2303 | NarrativeText | Each tissue—liver, bone, placenta, and intestine— produces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase. These variations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alka- line phosphatase is measured as the total amount or the amount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoen- zymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, and other processes in the laboratory. Methods to measure them separately are based on these differences. | No
2304 | NarrativeText | The test is covered by insurance when medically necessary. Results are usually available the next day. | No
2305 | Title | Preparation | No
2306 | NarrativeText | To collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the needle into an attached tube. Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes. | No
2307 | NarrativeText | A person being tested for alkaline phosphatase shouldn’t have anything to eat or drink, except water, for eight to ten hours before the test. Some people release alkaline phosphatase from the intestine into the blood- stream after eating. This will temporarily increase the result of the test. | No

2332 | NarrativeText | Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or ABPA, is one of four major types of infections in humans caused by Aspergillus fungi. ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in asthma patients who are allergic to this specific fungus. | No
2333 | Title | Description | No
2334 | NarrativeText | ABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of Aspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus. It is sometimes grouped together with other lung disorders characterized by eosinophilia—an abnormal increase of a certain type of white blood cell in the blood—under the heading of eosinophilic pneumonia. These disorders are also called hypersensitivity lung diseases. | No
2335 | NarrativeText | ABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the United States, although the reasons for the increase are not clear. The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmat- ics aged 20-40. It affects males and females equally. | No
2336 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
2337 | NarrativeText | ABPA develops when the patient breathes air con- taining Aspergillus spores. These spores are found worldwide, especially around riverbanks, marshes, bogs, forests, and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetation. They are also found on wet paint, construction materials, and in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomial infection, which means that a patient can get it in a hos- pital. When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which are the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs, the bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So the patient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes or coughs. Many patients with ABPA also run a low-grade fever and lose their appetites. | No
2338 | Title | Complications | No
2339 | NarrativeText | Patients with ABPA sometimes cough up large amounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis. They may also develop a serious long-term form of bronchiectasis, the formation of fibrous tissue in the lungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder | No
2340 | Title | 107 | No
2341 | Title | aspergillosis | No
2342 | NarrativeText | caused by repeated inflammation of the airway, and marked by the abnormal enlargement of, or damage to, the bronchial walls. ABPA sometimes occurs as a com- plication of cystic fibrosis. | No
2343 | Title | Diagnosis | No
2344 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination of the patient’s history and the results of blood tests, sputum tests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The doctor will be concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a wors- ening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or other lung disorders. There are seven major criteria for a diag- nosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: ¢ a history of asthma. | No
2345 | ListItem | * an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on a chest x ray. | No
2346 | ListItem | * bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or destruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes). | No
2347 | ListItem | « skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen. | No
2348 | ListItem | * eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum. | No
2349 | ListItem | + Aspergillus precipitins in the patient’s blood. Precip- itins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form a solid that separates from the rest of the solution in the test tube. | No
2350 | ListItem | ¢ a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to a class of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergic reactions to foreign particles. | No
2351 | NarrativeText | Other criteria that may be used to support the diag- nosis include the presence of Aspergillus in samples of the patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs of brown mucus, or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillus antigen. | No
2352 | Title | Laboratory tests | No
2353 | NarrativeText | The laboratory tests that are done to obtain this information include a complete blood count (CBC), a sputum culture, a blood serum test of IgE levels, and a skin test for the Aspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a small amount of antigen is injected into the upper layer of skin on the patient’s forearm about four inches below the elbow. If the patient has a high level of IgE antibodies in the tissue, he or she will develop what is called a “wheal and flare” reaction in about 15-20 min- utes. A “wheal and flare” reaction is characterized by the eruption of a reddened, itching spot on the skin. Some patients with ABPA will develop the so-called late reaction to the skin test, in which a red, sore, swollen area develops about six to eight hours after the initial reaction. | No
2354 | NarrativeText | Aspergillus can sometimes be seen under a micro- scope slide made from the patient’s sputum, but the diag- nosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul- tured in the laboratory. Aspergillus is easy to culture, and can be identified when it is stained with periodic acid- Schiff (PAS), Calcofluor, or potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparations. | No
2355 | Title | Diagnostic imaging | No
2356 | NarrativeText | Chest x rays and CT scans are used to check for the presence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs of bronchiectasis. | No
2357 | Title | Treatment | No
2358 | NarrativeText | ABPA is usually treated with prednisone (Meti- corten) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth, and with bronchodilators. | No
2359 | NarrativeText | Antifungal drugs are not used to treat ABPA because it is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather than by direct infection of tissue. | No
2360 | Title | Follow-up care | No
2361 | NarrativeText | Patients with ABPA should be given periodic checkups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. A spirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patient’s lung capacity. | No
2362 | Title | Prognosis | No
2363 | NarrativeText | Most patients with ABPA respond well to corticos- teroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with grad- ual improvement over time. The best indicator of a good prognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE level. Patients with lung complications from ABPA may devel- op severe airway obstruction. | No
2364 | Title | Prevention | No
2365 | NarrativeText | ABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillus is a common fungus; it can be found in the saliva and sputum of most healthy individuals. Patients with ABPA can pro- tect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks, com- post piles, bogs, marshes, and other locations with wet or rotting vegetation; by avoiding construction sites or newly painted surfaces; and by having their air condi- tioners cleaned regularly. Some patients may be helped by air filtration systems for their bedrooms or offices. | No

2402 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
2403 | Title | Causes | No
2404 | NarrativeText | AP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies, spe- cial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies are designed to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens. In some situations, antigen-antibody complexes can become too large to remain suspended in the blood- stream. When this occurs, they precipitate out and become lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the cap- illary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage. | No
2405 | NarrativeText | The source of the antigen causing AP is unknown. Antigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral infec- tion. More than 75% of patients report having had an infection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or gas- trointestinal system several weeks before the onset of AP. Other complex molecules can act as antigens as well, including drugs such as antibiotics or vaccines. Other- wise harmless substances that stimulate an immune reac- tion are known as allergens. Drug allergens that may cause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, and quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP include those for typhoid, measles, cholera, and yellow fever. | No
2406 | Title | Symptoms | No
2407 | NarrativeText | The onset of AP may be preceded by a headache, fever, and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop an itchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised, and may be small and freckle-like. The rash may also be larg- er, resembling a bruise. Rashes become purple and then rust colored over the course of a day, and fade after sev- eral weeks. Rashes are most common on the buttocks, abdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes higher on the body may also occur, especially in younger children. | No
2408 | NarrativeText | Joint pain and swelling is common, especially in the knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in almost all patients, along with blood in the body waste (feces). About half of all patients show blood in the urine, low urine volume, or other signs of kidney involvement. Kidney failure may occur due to widespread obstruction of the capillaries in the filtering structures called glomeruli. Kidney failure develops in about 5% of all patients, and in 15% of those with elevated blood or pro- tein in the urine. | No

2416 | NarrativeText | Most cases of AP resolve completely without treat- ment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required because of the possibility of serious complications. Non-aspirin pain relievers may be given for joint pain. Corticosteroids (like prednisone) are sometimes used, although not all special- ists agree on their utility. Kidney involvement requires monitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes. | No
2417 | NarrativeText | Patients with severe kidney complications may require a kidney biopsy so that tissue can be analyzed. Even after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels of blood or protein in the urine may persist for months and require regular monitoring. Hypertension or kidney fail- ure may develop months or even years after the acute phase of the disease. Kidney failure requires dialysis or transplantation. | No

2431 | NarrativeText | Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common allergic condition and one of the most common of all minor afflictions. It affects between 10-20% of all people in the United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doc- tor visits. Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat allergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of both prescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year. | No
2432 | NarrativeText | There are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal and perennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer, and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at their highest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really a mis- nomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause of symptoms for most people. Perennial AR occurs all year and is usually caused by home or workplace airborne pollutants. A person can be affected by one or both types. Symptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being out- doors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst after spending time indoors. | No
2433 | NarrativeText | Both types of allergies can develop at any age, although onset in childhood through early adulthood is most common. Although allergy to a particular substance is not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity may “run in the family.” While allergies can improve on their own over time, they can also become worse over time. | No

2436 | NarrativeText | Allergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction. Nor- mally, the immune system responds to foreign microor- ganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by producing specific proteins, called antibodies, that are capable of binding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the for- eign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is the condition known as allergy, and the offending substance is called an allergen. d1849]|V | No
2437 | NarrativeText | Like all allergic reactions, AR involves a special set of cells in the immune system known as mast cells. Mast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passages and eyelids, display a special type of antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets, called granules. When the antibodies encounter aller- gens, they trigger release of the granules, which spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells, through special proteins called histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood ves- sels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased redness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in aller- gic rhinitis. | No
2438 | NarrativeText | The number of possible airborne allergens is enor- mous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grass and tree pollens, since their pollen is produced in large amounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy flowers, like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce a sticky pollen which is less likely to become airborne. Different plants release their pollen at different times of the year, so seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in spring, summer, or fall, depending on which plants provoke a response. The amount of pollen in the air is reflected in the pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news dur- ing allergy season. Pollen counts tend to be lower after a good rain that washes the pollen out of the air and higher on warm, dry, windy days. | No
2439 | NarrativeText | Virtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR. A few types of weeds that tend to cause the most trouble for people include the following: * ragweed * sagebrush | No
2440 | ListItem | ¢ lamb’s-quarters + plantain | No
2441 | ListItem | * pigweed ¢ dock/sorrel | No
2442 | NarrativeText | This illustration depicts excessive mucus production in the nose after inhalation of airborne pollen. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.) | No
2443 | ListItem | * tumbleweed Perennial AR is often triggered by house dust, a complicated mixture of airborne particles, many of which are potent allergens. House dust contains some or all of the following: * house mite body parts. All houses contain large num- bers of microscopic insects called house mites. These harmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed by the house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts easi- ly become airborne. | No
2444 | ListItem | * animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin flakes, and dried saliva. Carried in the air, or transferred from pet to owner by direct contact, dander can cause allergy in many sensitive people. | No

2450 | ListItem | * copier chemicals + industrial chemicals | No
2451 | ListItem | * construction material gases | No
2452 | Title | Symptoms | No
2453 | NarrativeText | Inflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the major symptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching, sneezing, runny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus swelling can constrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner ear to the throat, causing a congested feeling and “ear pop- ping.” The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the back of the throat, combined with increased sensitivity, can also lead to throat irritation and redness. AR usually also causes redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigue and headache are also common. | No
2454 | Title | Diagnosis | No
2455 | NarrativeText | Diagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can often be done without a medical specialist. When symp- toms appear in spring or summer and disappear with the onset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost certainly the culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, including infection, can usually be ruled out by a physical examination and a nasal smear, in which a sample of mucus is taken on a swab for examination. | No
2456 | NarrativeText | Allergy tests, including skin testing and provoca- tion testing, can help identify the precise culprit, but may not be done unless a single source is suspected and subsequent avoidance is possible. Skin testing involves placing a small amount of liquid containing a specific allergen on the skin and then either poking, scratching, or injecting it into the skin surface to observe whether redness and swelling occurs. Provocation testing involves challenging an individual with either a small amount of an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if a response is elicited. | No
2457 | NarrativeText | Perennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by care- ful questioning about the timing of exposure and the onset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be identified through allergy skin testing. | No
2458 | Title | Treatment | No
2459 | NarrativeText | Avoidance of the allergens is the best treatment, but this is often not possible. When it is not possible to avoid one or more allergens, there are two major forms of med- ical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy. | No
2460 | Title | Drugs | No
2461 | NarrativeText | ANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the hista- mine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of histamine release by mast cells. They may be used after symptoms appear, though they may be even more effec- tive when used preventively, before symptoms appear. A wide variety of antihistamines are available. | No
2462 | NarrativeText | Older antihistamines often produce drowsiness as a major side effect. Such antihistamines include the fol- lowing: ¢ diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics) | No
2463 | ListItem | ¢ chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics) | No
2464 | ListItem | * brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics) | No
2465 | ListItem | * clemastine (Tavist and generics). | No
2466 | NarrativeText | Newer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness are available by prescription and include the following: * astemizole (Hismanal) | No
2467 | ListItem | ¢ loratidine (Claritin) | No
2468 | ListItem | fexofenadine (Allegra) | No
2469 | ListItem | ¢ azelastin HCI (Astelin). | No
2470 | NarrativeText | Hismanal has the potential to cause serious heart arrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic ery- thromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra- conazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more than the recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause arrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non- drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because of this potential and because of the availability of an equal- ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine. | No
2471 | NarrativeText | DECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood vessels to counteract the effects of histamine. Nasal sprays are available that can be applied directly to the nasal lining and oral systemic preparations are available. Decongestants are stimulants and may cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, headaches, and agitation. Use of topical deconges- tants for longer than several days can cause loss of effective- ness and rebound congestion, in which nasal passages become more severely swollen than before treatment. | No
2472 | NarrativeText | TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticos- teroids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are available by prescription. Allergies tend to become worse as the season progresses because the immune system becomes sensitized to particular antigens and can pro- duce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroids are especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensiti- zation because they work more slowly and last longer than most other medication types. As a result, they are best started before allergy season begins. Side effects are usually mild, but may include headaches, nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations. | No
2473 | NarrativeText | MAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium prevents the release of mast cell granules, thereby preventing release of histamine and the other chemicals contained in them. It acts as a preventive treatment if it is begun sever- al weeks before the onset of the allergy season. It can be used for perennial AR as well. | No
2474 | Title | mmunotherapy | No
2475 | NarrativeText | Immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or allergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergic reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testing to determine the precise allergens responsible. Injections involve very small but gradually increasing amounts of allergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic boosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to achieve and are not seen at all in about one in five patients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitored closely following each shot because of the small risk of anaphylaxis, a condition that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure. | No
2476 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
2477 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments for AR often focus on modu- lation of the body’s immune response, and frequently center around diet and lifestyle adjustments. Chinese herbal medicine can help rebalance a person’s system, as can both acute and constitutional homeopathic treatment. Vitamin C in substantial amounts can help stabilize the mucous membrane response. For symptom relief, west- ern herbal remedies including eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis) and nettle (Urtica dioica) may be helpful. Bee pollen may also be effective in alleviating or elimi- nating AR symptoms. | No
2478 | Title | Prognosis | No
2479 | NarrativeText | Most people with AR can achieve adequate relief with a combination of preventive strategies and treat- ment. While allergies may improve over time, they may also get worse or expand to include new allergens. Early treatment can help prevent an increased sensitization to other allergens. | No

2510 | NarrativeText | Allergies are abnormal reactions of the immune sys- tem that occur in response to otherwise harmless sub- stances. | No
2511 | Title | Description | No
2512 | NarrativeText | Allergies are among the most common of medical disorders. It is estimated that 60 million Americans, or more than one in every five people, suffer from some form of allergy, with similar proportions throughout much of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single largest reason for school absence and is a major source of lost productivity in the workplace. | No
2513 | NarrativeText | An allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally, the immune system responds to foreign microorganisms or particles by producing specific proteins called anti- bodies. These antibodies are capable of binding to iden- tifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigen sets off a series of chemical reactions designed to protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances such as pollen, dust, and animal danders. When this occurs, an allergy develops against the offending sub- stance (an allergen.) | No
2514 | NarrativeText | Mast cells, one of the major players in allergic reac- tions, capture and display a particular type of antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that binds to aller- gens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packets called granules. Granules contain a variety of potent chemicals, including histamine. | No
2515 | NarrativeText | Immunologists separate allergic reactions into two main types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions, which are predominantly mast cell-mediated and occur within minutes of contact with allergen; and delayed hypersen- sitivity reactions, mediated by T cells (a type of white blood cells) and occurring hours to days after exposure. | No
2516 | NarrativeText | Inhaled or ingested allergens usually cause immedi- ate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind to IgE anti- bodies on the surface of mast cells, which spill the con- tents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, includ- ing blood vessels and nerve cells. Histamine binds to the surfaces of these other cells through special proteins called histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness, leading to the fluid collection, swelling and increased redness. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, mak- ing tissue more sensitive and irritable. Symptoms last from one to several hours following contact. | No
2517 | NarrativeText | In the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersen- sitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy, blood- shot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis. In the gastrointesti- nal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and irritation of the intestinal lining, which causes the cramping and diarrhea typical of food allergy. Allergens that enter the circulation may cause hives, angioedema, anaphylaxis, or atopic dermatitis. | No
2518 | NarrativeText | Allergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper- sensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen, setting in motion a more prolonged immune response. This type of allergic response may develop over several days following contact with the allergen, and symptoms may persist for a week or more. | No
2519 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
2520 | NarrativeText | Allergens enter the body through four main routes: the airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and the circulatory system. | No
2521 | ListItem | + Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose, and itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever (allergic rhini- tis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of the lungs, causing asthma, or the conjunctiva of the eyes, causing conjunctivitis (pink eye). Exposure to cock- roach allergans have been associated with the devel- opment of asthma. Airborne allergans from household pets are another common source of environmental exposure. | No
2522 | ListItem | Allergens in food can cause itching and swelling of the lips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When absorbed into the bloodstream, they may cause hives (urticaria) or more severe reactions involving recurrent, non- inflammatory swelling of the skin, mucous membranes, organs, and brain (angioedema). Some food allergens may cause anaphylaxis,a potentially life-threatening condition marked by tissue swelling, airwayconstric- tion, and drop in blood pressure. Allergies to foods such cow’s milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts and soybeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegeta- bles may also occur. | No
2523 | ListItem | In contact with the skin, allergens can cause redden- ing, itching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis. Skin reactions can also occur from allergens intro- duced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract. This type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis. Dermatitis may arise from an allergic response (such as from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant causing nonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap, cold, and chemical agents). | No
2524 | ListItem | Injection of allergens, from insect bites and stings or drug administration, can introduce allergens directly into the circulation, where they may cause system-wide responses (including anaphylaxis), as well as the local ones of swelling and irritation at the injection site. | No
2525 | NarrativeText | People with allergies are not equally sensitive to all allergens. Some may have severe allergic rhinitis but no food allergies, for instance, or be extremely sen- sitive to nuts but not to any other food. Allergies may get worse over time. For example, childhood ragweed allergy may progress to year-round dust and pollen allergy. On the other hand, a person may lose allergic sensitivity. Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disap- pears in almost all people. More commonly, what seems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reduced exposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for the same level of symptoms. | No
2526 | NarrativeText | While allergy to specific allergens is not inherited, the likelihood of developing some type of allergy seems to be, at least for many people. If neither parent has allergies, the chances of a child developing allergy is approximately 10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is 30-50%; and if both have allergies, it is 40-75%.One source of this genetic predisposition is in the ability to produce higher levels of IgE in response to allergens. Those who produce more IgE will develop a stronger allergic sensitivity. | No

2541 | ListItem | + fleas * scabies | No
2542 | NarrativeText | Symptoms depend on the specific type of allergic reaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy, runny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat due to post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membrane covering the eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes redness, irritation, and increased tearing in the eyes. Asthma caus- es wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Symp- toms of food allergies depend on the tissues most sensi- tive to the allergen and whether the allergen spread sys- temically by the circulatory system. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lips, tongue, palate or throat; nausea; cramping; diarrhea; and gas. Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened, itchy, weepy skin blisters, and an eczema that is slow to heal. It sometimes has a characteritic man-made pattern, such as a glove allergy with clear demarkation on the hands, wrist, and arms where the gloves are worn, or on the ear- lobes by wearing earrings. | No
2543 | NarrativeText | Whole body or systemic reactions may occur from any type of allergen, but are more common following ingestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactions include the raised, reddened, and itchy patches called hives that characteristically blanch with pressure and resolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and more extensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluid collection and pain, is called angioedema. This usually occurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of the head,neck,and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airway constriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissue swelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some cases, loss of consciousness. Other syptoms may include, dizzi- ness, weakness, seizures, coughing,flushing, or cramp- ing. The symptoms may begin within five minutes after exposure to the allergan up to one hour or more later. Mast cells in the tissues and basophils in the blood release mediators that give rise to the clinical symptoms of this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Common- ly, this is associated with allergies to medications, foods, and insect venoms. In some individuals, anaphylaxis can occur with exercise, plasma exchange, hemodialysis, reaction to insulin, radocontrast media used in certain Allergic rhinitis is commonly triggered by exposure to household dust, animal fur, or pollen. The foreign substance that triggers an allergic reaction is called an allergen. The presence of an allergen causes the body's lymphocytes to begin producing IgE antibodies.

2547 | NarrativeText | Allergies can often be diagnosed by a careful med- ical history, matching the onset of symptoms to the exposure to possible allergens. Allergy is suspected if the symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergic reaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure to the suspected allergan. Allergy tests can be used to identify potential allergens, but these must be supported by eveidence of allergic responses in the patient’s clini- cal history. | No

A positive reaction will occur on the skin even if the aller- gen is at levels normally encountered in food or in the airways. Reactions are usually evaluated approximately fifteen minutes after exposure. Intradermal skin tests involved injection of the allergan into the dermis of the skin. These tests are more sensitive and are used for allergies associated with risk of death, such as allergies to antibiotics. | No
2549 | Title | Allergen-Specific gE Measurement | No
2550 | Title | Skin tests | No
2551 | NarrativeText | Skin tests are performed by administering a tiny dose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching, puncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is applied to the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on the back, forearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the skin, the aller- gen may produce a classic immune wheal and flare response (a skin lesion with a raise, white, compressible area surrounded by a red flare). The tests usually begin Tests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibodies generally follow a basic method. The allergen is bound to a solid support, either in the form of a cellulose sponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The patient’s serum is prepared from a blood sample and is incubated with the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE antibodies are present, they will bind to the solid phase and be retained there when the rest of the serum is washed away. Next, an labeled antibody against the IgE is added and will bind to any IgE on the solid phase. The excess is washed away and the levels of IgE are determined. The commonly used RAST test (radio allergo sorbent | No
2552 | ListItem | Allergies test) employed radio-labeled Anti-IgE antibodies. Updated methods now incorporate the use of enyzme- labeled antibodies in ELISA assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays). | No
2553 | Title | Total Serum gE | No
2554 | NarrativeText | The total level of IgE in the serum is commonly measured with a two-site immunometric assay. Some research indicates that there is a higher level of total serum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic peo- ple. However, this may not always be the case as there is considerable overlap between the two groups.This test is useful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Other conditions that are not allergic in nature may give rise to higher IgE lev- els such as smoking, AIDS, infection with parasites, and IgE myeloma. | No
2555 | Title | Provocation tests | No
2556 | NarrativeText | These tests involve the administration of allergen to ellicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most com- monly done with airborne allergens, present the allergen directly through the route normally involved. Delayed allergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similar methods by application of a skin patch with allergen to induce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provoca- tion tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen for two weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a measured amount of the test substance administered as an opaque capsule along with a placebo control. Provocation tests are not used if anaphylaxis is is a concern due to the patient’s medical history. | No
2557 | Title | Future diagnostic methods | No
2558 | NarrativeText | As of 2000, attempts have been made for direct measurement of immune mediators such as histamine, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and mast cell tryptase. Another, somewhat controversial,test is elec- trodermal testing or electro-acupuncture allergy testing. This test has been used in Europe and is under investiga- tion in the United States, though not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An electric potential is applied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the elec- trical resistance observed for changes. This method has not been verified. | No

Dust mite control is particularly important in the bedroom areas by use of allergen-impermeable covers on mattress and pillows, frequent washing of bedding in hot water,and removal of items that collect dust such as stuffed toys. Mold growth may be reduced by reducing indoor humidity, repair of house foundations to reduce indoor leaks and seepage, and installation of exhaust sys- tems to ventilate areas where steam is generated such as the bathroom or kitchen. Allergic individuals should avoid pet allergens such as saliva, body excretions, pelts, urine, or feces. For those who insist on keeping a pet, restriction of the animal’s activity to certain areas of the home may be beneficial. | No
2563 | NarrativeText | Complete environmental control is often difficult to accomplish, hence therapuetic interventions may become necessary. A large number of prescription and over-the-counter drugs are available for treatment of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Most of these work by decreasing the ability of histamine to provoke symptoms. Other drugs counteract the effects of hista- mine by stimulating other systems or reducing immune responses in general. | No

2578 | NarrativeText | Topical corticosteroids reduce mucous membrane inflammationas by decreasing the amount of fluid moved from the vascular spaces into the tissues. These medications reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells as well as the synthesis of cytokines. They are available by prescription. Allergies tend to become worse as the season progresses because the immune sys- tem becomes sensitized to particular antigens and can produce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticos- teroids are especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensitization because they work more slowly and last longer than most other medication types. As a result, they are best started before allergy season begins. Side effects are usually mild, but may include headaches, nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations. | No

2598 | NarrativeText | bronchodilators, which cause the smooth muscle lining the airways to open or dilate, can be very effective. When inahlers are used, it is important that the patient be educated in the proper use of these medications. The inhaler should be shaken, and the patient should breathe out to expel air from the lungs. The inhaler should be place at least two fingerbreadths in front of the mouth. The medication should be aimed at the back of the throat, and the inhaler activated while breathing in quite slowly 3-4 seconds. The breath should be held for at least ten seconds, and then expelled. At least thirty to sixty seconds should pass before the inhaler is used again. Care should be taken to properly wash out the mouth and brush the teeth following use, as residual medication remains in this area with only a small amount actually reaching the lungs. Some bronchodila- tors used to treat acute asthma attacks include adrena- line, albuterol, or other “adrenoceptor stimulants,” most often administered as aerosols. Futicasone (Flovent) is another commonly prescribed inhaler. Some bron- chodilators used to treat acute asthma attacks include adrenaline, albuterol, Maxair, Proventil, or other “adrenoceptor stimulants,” most often administered as aerosols. Another group of medications, the long-acting beta agonists, are proving useful to reduce the use of inhalers.and include salmeterol xinafoate (Serevent). Theophylline,naturally present in coffee and tea, is another drug that produces brochodilation.It is usually taken orally, but in a severe asthma attack is may be given intravenously. Side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances, insomnia, headaches, and seizures. | No

2606 | Title | Treatment of contact dermatitis | No
2607 | NarrativeText | An individual suffering from contact dermatitis should initially take steps to avoid possible wources of exposure to the offending agent. Calamine lotion applied to affected skin can reduce irritation somewhat, as can cold water compresses. Side effects of topical agents may include over-drying of the skin.In the case of acute contact dermatitis, short-term oral corticosteroid therapy may be appropriate. Moderately strong coricosteroids can also be applied as a wrap for twenty-four hours. Health care workers are especially at risk for hand erup- tions due to glove use. | No
2608 | Title | Treatment of anaphylaxis | No
2609 | NarrativeText | The emergency condition of anaphylaxis is treated with injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine. People who are prone to anaphylaxis because of food or insect allergies often carry an “Epi-pen” containing adrenaline in a hypodermic needle. Other medications may be given to aid the action of the epi-pen. Prompt injection can prevent a more serious reaction from developing. Paticular care should be taken to assess the affected individual’s airway status, and he or she should be placed in a recumbent pose and vital signs deter- mined. If a reaction resulted from insect sting or an injection, a tourniquet may need to be placed proximal to the area where the agent penetrated the skin. This should then be released at intervals of ten minutes at a time, for one to two minutes duration. If the individual does not respond to such interventions, then emergency treatment is appropriate. | No
2610 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
2611 | NarrativeText | Any alternative treatment for allergies begins with finding the cause and then helping the patient to avoid or eliminate the allergen, although this is not always possible. As with any alternative therapy, a physician should be consulted before initiating a new form of treatment. Education on the use of alternative agents is critical, as they are still “drugs” even though they are derived from natural sources.Various categories of alternative remedies may be helpful in allergy treat- ment, including: * antihistamines: vitamin C and the bioflavonoid hes- peridin act as natural anithistamines. | No
2612 | ListItem | + decongestants: vitamin C, the homeopathic remedies Ferrum phosphoricum and Kali muriaticum (used alter- nately), and the dietary supplement N-acetylcysteine are believed to have decongestant effects. | No

2615 | ListItem | * bronchodilators: the herbal remedies ephedra (Ephedra sinica, also known as ma huang in traditional Chinese medicine), khellin (Ammi visnaga) and cramp bark (Viburnum opulus) are believed to help open the airways. | No
2616 | Title | Treatment of contact dermatitis | No
2617 | NarrativeText | A variety of herbal remedies, either applied topical- ly or taken internally, may possibly assist in the treat- ment of contact dermatitis. A poultice (crushed herbs applied directly to the affected area) made of jewelweed (Impatiens spp.) or chickweed (Stellaria media) may soothe the skin. A cream or wash containing calendula (Calendula officinalis), a natural antiseptic and anti- inflammatory agent, may help heal the rash when applied topically. Homeopathic treatment may include such remedies as Rhus toxicodendron, Apis mellifica, or Anacardium taken internally. A qualified homeopathic practitioner should be consulted to match the symptoms with the correct remedy. Care should be taken with any agent taken internally. | No
2618 | Title | Prognosis | No
2619 | NarrativeText | Allergies can improve over time, although they often worsen. While anaphylaxis and severe asthma are life- threatening, other allergic reactions are not. Learning to recognize and avoid allergy-provoking situations allows most people with allergies to lead normal lives. | No
2620 | Title | Prevention | No
2621 | NarrativeText | Avoiding allergens is the best means of limiting allergic reactions. For food allergies, there is no effective treatment except avoidance. By determining the allergens that are causing reactions, most people can learn to avoid allergic reactions from food, drugs, and contact allergens such as poison ivy or latex. Airborne allergens are more difficult to avoid, although keeping dust and animal dan- der from collecting in the house may limit exposure. Cromolyn sodium can prevent mast cell degranulation, thereby limiting the allergic response. | No
2622 | NarrativeText | Immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or allergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergic reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by aller- gy testing to determine the precise allergens responsi- ble. Injections involve very small but gradually increasing amounts of allergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic boosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to achieve and are not seen at all in about one in five patients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitored closely following each shot because of the small risk of anaphylaxis, a condition that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure. | No

2635 | NarrativeText | Allergy tests indicate a person’s allergic sensitivity to commonly encountered environmental substances. | No
2636 | Title | Purpose | No
2637 | NarrativeText | Allergy is a reaction of the immune system. Nor- mally, the immune system responds to foreign microor- ganisms and particles, like pollen or dust, by producing specific proteins called antibodies that are capable of binding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign organisms. This reaction between antibody and antigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is the condition known as allergy, and the offend- ing substance is called an allergen. Common inhaled allergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from tiny house mites. Common food allergens include nuts, fish, and milk. | No
2638 | NarrativeText | Allergic reactions involve a special set of cells in the immune system known as mast cells. Mast cells serve as guards in the tissues where the body meets the outside world: the skin, the mucous membranes of the eyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratory and digestive systems. Mast cells display a special type of antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets, called granules. When the antibodies encounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules, which spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells, through special proteins called histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased redness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in allergic rhinitis. | No
2639 | NarrativeText | The particular allergens to which a person is sensi- tive can be determined through allergy testing. Allergy tests may be performed on the skin or using blood serum in a test tube. During skin tests, potential allergens are placed on the skin and the reaction is observed. In radio- allergosorbent allergy testing (RAST), a patient’s blood serum is combined with allergen in a test tube to deter- mine if serum antibodies react with the allergen. Provo- cation testing involves direct exposure to a likely aller- gen, either through inhalation or ingestion. Positive reac- tions from any of these tests may be used to narrow the candidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy. | No
2640 | NarrativeText | Identification of the allergenic substance may allow the patient to avoid the substance and reduce allergic reactions. In addition, allergy testing may be done in those with asthma that is difficult to manage, eczema, or skin rashes to determine if an allergy is causing the con- dition or making it worse. Allergy tests may also be done before allergen desensitization to ensure the safety of more extensive exposure. | No
2641 | NarrativeText | Skin testing is the most common type of allergy test. There are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. In percutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions are placed on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with a needle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin and become exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in which the skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used less often. Intradermal testing involves directly injecting allergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened, swollen spot develops at the injection site for each sub- stance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity is seen for allergens regardless of whether they usually affect the skin. In other words, airborne and food aller- gens cause skin reactions equally well. | No
2642 | NarrativeText | The range of allergens used for testing is chosen to reflect possible sources in the environment and may include the following: * pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, and weeds ¢ mold and fungus spores | No
2643 | ListItem | * house dust * house mites | No
2644 | ListItem | ¢ animal skin cells (dander) and saliva + food extracts | No
2645 | ListItem | * antibiotics * insect venoms | No
2646 | NarrativeText | Radio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratory test performed when a person may be too sensitive to risk skin testing or when medications or skin conditions pre- vent it. | No
2647 | NarrativeText | Provocation testing is done to positively identify suspected allergens after preliminary skin testing. A puri- fied preparation of the allergen is inhaled or ingested in increasing concentrations to determine if it will provoke a response. Food testing is much more tedious than inhalation testing, since full passage through the diges- tive system may take a day or more. | No

2649 | Title | Precautions | No
2650 | NarrativeText | While allergy tests are quite safe for most people, the possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxis does exist. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous condition that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure. People with a known history of anaphy- laxis should inform the testing clinician. Skin tests should never include a substance known to cause ana- phylaxis in the person being tested. | No
2651 | NarrativeText | Provocation tests may cause an allergic reaction. Therefore, treatment medications should be available fol- lowing the tests, to be administered, if needed. | No
2652 | Title | Description | No
2653 | NarrativeText | In prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be tested is placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back. A typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergen drops, including a drop of saline solution that should not provoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of hista- mine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). A small needle is inserted through the drop, and used to prick the skin below. A new needle is used for each prick. The sites are examined over the next twenty minutes for evidence of swelling and redness, indicating a positive reaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set of reac- tions may be made by placing paper over the tested area. Similarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections are made for each allergen tested. Observations are made over the next twenty minutes. | No
2654 | NarrativeText | In RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in the laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum is separated from the blood cells. The serum is then exposed to allergens bound to a solid medium. If a per- son has antibodies to a particular allergen, those antibod- rest 2 | No

Location of allergen-antibody combinations is done by adding antibody-reactive antibodies, so called anti-antibodies, that are chemically linked with a radioactive dye. By locating radioactive spots on the solid medium, the reactive allergens are discovered. | No
2657 | NarrativeText | Provocation testing may be performed to identify air- borne or food allergens. Inhalation testing is performed only after a patient’s lung capacity and response to the medium used to dilute the allergen has been determined. Once this has been determined, the patient inhales increas- ingly concentrated samples of a particular allergen, fol- lowed each time by measurement of the exhalation capaci- ty. Only one allergen is tested per day. Testing for food allergies is usually done by removing the suspect food from the diet for two weeks, followed by eating a single portion of the suspect food and follow-up monitoring. | No
2658 | Title | Preparation | No
2659 | NarrativeText | Skin testing is preceded by a brief examination of the skin. The patient should refrain from using anti-aller- gy drugs for at least 48 hours before testing. Prior to inhalation testing, patients with asthma who can tolerate it may be asked to stop any asthma medications. Testing for food allergies requires the person to avoid all suspect food for at least two weeks before testing. | No
2660 | Title | Aftercare | No
2661 | NarrativeText | Skin testing does not usually require any aftercare. A generalized redness and swelling may occur in the test area, but it will usually resolve within a day or two. | No
2662 | NarrativeText | Inhalation tests may cause delayed asthma attacks, even if the antigen administered in the test initially pro- duced no response. Severe initial reactions may justify close professional observation for at least 12 hours after testing. | No

2671 | Title | Risks | No
2672 | NarrativeText | Intradermal testing may inadvertently result in the injection of the allergen into the circulation, with an increased risk of adverse reactions. Inhalation tests may provoke an asthma attack. Exposure to new or unsuspect- ed allergens in any test carries the risk of anaphylaxis. Because patients are monitored following allergy testing, an anaphylactic reaction is usually recognized and treat- ed promptly. Occasionally, a delayed anaphylactic response can occur that will require immediate care. Proper patient education regarding how to recognize ana- phylaxis is vital. | No
2673 | Title | Normal results | No
2674 | NarrativeText | Lack of redness or swelling on a skin test indicates no allergic response. In an inhalation test, the exhalation capacity should remain unchanged. In a food challenge, no symptoms should occur. | No
2675 | Title | Abnormal results | No
2676 | NarrativeText | Presence of redness or swelling, especially over 5 mm (1/4 inch) in diameter, indicates an allergic response. | No
2677 | NarrativeText | This does not mean the substance actually causes the patient’s symptoms, however, since he or she may have no regular exposure to the allergen. In fact, the actual allergen may not have been included in the test array. | No
2678 | NarrativeText | Following allergen inhalation, reduction in exhala- tion capacity of more than 20%, and for at least 10-20 minutes, indicates a positive reaction to the allergen. | No

2689 | Title | Description | No
2690 | NarrativeText | Hair loss occurs for a great many reasons—from pulling it out to having it killed off by cancer chemo- therapy. Some causes are considered natural, while oth- ers signal serious health problems. Some conditions are confined to the scalp. Others reflect disease throughout the body. Being plainly visible, the skin and its compo- nents can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in the body. | No
2691 | NarrativeText | Oftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the scalp will result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific cause is the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete bald- ness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning, or hair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is the condition of the hair and the scalp beneath it. Sometimes only the hair is affected; sometimes the skin is visibly diseased as well. | No

There is also an over-the-counter extra-strength version of minoxidil (5% concentration) approved for use by men only. The treat- ment often results in new hair that is thinner and lighter in color. It is important to note that new hair stops grow- ing soon after the use of minoxidil is discontinued. | No
2717 | NarrativeText | Over the past few decades there have appeared a multitude of hair replacement methods performed by both physicians and non-physicians. They range from simply weaving someone else’s hair in with the remains of your own to surgically transplanting thousands of hair follicles one at a time. | No
2718 | NarrativeText | Hair transplantation is completed by taking tiny plugs of skin, each containing one to several hairs, from the back side of the scalp. The bald sections are then implanted with the plugs. Research completed in 2000 looked at the new technique of hair grafting, and found that micrografts (one to two hairs transplanted per follicle) resulted in fewer complications and the best results Another surgical procedure used to treat androgenic alopecia is scalp reduction. By stretching skin the hair- less scalp can be removed and the area of bald skin decreased by closing the space with hair-covered scalp.

2739 | NarrativeText | The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test is a blood test that is performed during pregnancy. This screening test mea- sures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood and indi- cates the probability that the fetus has one of several seri- ous birth defects. The level of AFP can also be deter- mined by analyzing a sample of amniotic fluid. This screening test cannot diagnose a specific condition; it only indicates the increase of risk for several birth defects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used to detect liver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and to monitor the progress of cancer treatment. | No
2740 | Title | Purpose | No
2741 | NarrativeText | Alpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the liver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein is unknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producing AFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts. During pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine and some of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enter the mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then be deter- mined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s blood. By analyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amni- otic fluid sample, doctors can determine the probability that the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects. It is very important that the doctor know precisely how old the fetus is when the test is performed since the AFP level changes over the length of the pregnancy. Alone, AFP screening cannot diagnose a birth defect. The test is used as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate line of testing (like amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows, based on the results. | No
2742 | NarrativeText | Abnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetus has an increased risk of a neural tube defect, the most common and severe type of disorder associated with increased AFP. These types of defects include spinal column defects (spina bifida) and anencephaly (a severe and usually fatal brain abnormality). If the tube that becomes the brain and spinal cord does not close correctly during fetal development, AFP may leak through this abnormal opening and enter the amniotic fluid. This leakage creates abnormally high levels of AFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood. If the screening test indicates abnormally high AFP, ultra- sound is used to diagnosis the problem. | No
2743 | NarrativeText | Other fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels above normal include: * cysts at the end of the spine + blockage in the esophagus or intestines | No
2744 | ListItem | + liver disease causing liver cells to die + defects in the abdominal wall | No
2745 | ListItem | + kidney or urinary tract defects or disease + brittle bone disease | No
2746 | NarrativeText | Levels may also be high if there is too little fluid in the amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one devel- oping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along than estimated. | No
2747 | NarrativeText | For unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may indicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down syndrome. Down syndrome is a condition that includes mental retardation and a distinctive physical appearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome 21 (called trisomy 21). If the screening test indicates an abnormally low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diag- nosis the problem. Abnormally low levels of AFP can also occur when the fetus has died or when the mother is overweight. | No
2748 | NarrativeText | AFP is often part of a “triple check” blood test that analyzes three substances as risk indicators of possible birth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances are mea- sured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of the test results increases. | No
2749 | NarrativeText | Although AFP in human blood gradually disappears after birth, it never disappears entirely. It may reappear in liver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles. The AFP test is used to screen people at high risk for these conditions. After a cancerous tumor is removed, an | No

2755 | Title | Precautions | No
2756 | NarrativeText | It is very important that the doctor know precisely how old the fetus is when the test is performed since the AFP level considered normal changes over the length of the pregnancy. Errors in determining the age of the fetus lead to errors when interpreting the test results. Since an AFP test is only a screening tool, more specific tests must follow to make an accurate diagnosis. An abnormal test result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has a birth defect. The test has a high rate of abnormal results (either high or low) in order to prevent missing a fetus that has a serious condition. | No
2757 | Title | Description | No
2758 | NarrativeText | The AFP test is usually performed at week 16 of pregnancy. Blood is drawn from a vein, usually on the inside of the elbow. AFP can also be measured in the sam- ple of amniotic fluid taken at the time of amniocentesis. Test results are usually available after about one week. | No

2770 | Title | Abnormal results | No
2771 | NarrativeText | The doctor will inform the woman of her specific increased risk as compared to the “normal” risk of a stan- dard case. If the risk of Down syndrome is greater than the standard risk for women who are 35 years old or older (one in 270), then amniocentesis is recommended. Again, the test has a high rate of showing an abnormal AFP level in order to prevent missing a fetus that has Down’s syndrome. This screening test only predicts risk; appropriate diagnostic testing will follow after an abnor- mal screening result. | No

2789 | NarrativeText | Alpha,-adrenergic blockers are drugs that work by blocking the alpha,-receptors of vascular smooth muscle, thus preventing the uptake of catecholamines by the smooth muscle cells. This causes vasodilation and allows blood to flow more easily. | No
2790 | Title | Purpose | No
2791 | NarrativeText | These drugs, called alpha blockers for short, are used for two main purposes: to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition that affects men and is characterized by an enlarged prostate gland. | No
2792 | Title | High blood pressure | No
2793 | NarrativeText | High blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and the arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage the blood vessels to the point of causing stroke, heart fail- ure or kidney failure. People with high blood pressure may also be at higher risk for heart attacks. Controlling high blood pressure makes these problems less likely. Alpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causing vasodilation, meaning an increase in the diameter of the blood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily. | No
2794 | Title | Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) | No
2795 | NarrativeText | This condition particularly affects older men. Over time, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland below the blad- der, enlarges. When this happens, it may interfere with the passage of urine from the bladder out of the body. Men who are diagnosed with BPH may have to urinate more often. Or they may feel that they can not complete- ly empty their bladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the con- traction of prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax mus- cles in the prostate and the bladder, allowing urine to flow more freely. | No
2796 | Title | Description | No
2797 | NarrativeText | Commonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyperten- sion and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazosin (Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also used in the treatment of heart failure. All are available only with a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet form. | No
2798 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
2799 | NarrativeText | The recommended dose depends on the patient and the type of alpha blocker and may change over the course of treatment. The prescribing physician will gradually increase the dosage, if necessary. Some patients may need as much as 15-20 mg per day of terazosin, 16 mg per day of doxazosin, or as much as 40 mg per day of prazosin, but most people benefit from lower doses. As the dosage increases, so does the possibility of unwanted side effects. | No
2800 | NarrativeText | Alpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed, even if the medication does not seem to be working at first. It should not be stopped even if symptoms improve because it needs to be taken regularly to be effective. Patients should avoid missing any doses, and should not take larger or more frequent doses to make up for missed doses. | No
2801 | Title | Precautions | No
2802 | NarrativeText | Alpha blockers may lower blood pressure to a greater extent than desired. This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, heart palpitations, and fainting. Activ- ities such as driving, using machines, or doing anything else that might be dangerous for 24 hours after taking the first dose should be avoided. Patients should be reminded to be especially careful not to fall when getting up in the middle of the night. The same precautions are recom- mended if the dosage is increased or if the drug has been stopped and then started again. Anyone whose safety on the job could be affected by taking alpha blockers should inform his or her physician, so that the physician can take this factor into account when increasing dosage. | No
2803 | NarrativeText | Dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are more like- ly to occur when people taking alpha blockers also drink alcohol, exercise, stand for a long time, or are exposed to hot weather. Extra care should be used under these condi- tions and alcohol consumption should be limited. | No
2804 | NarrativeText | Some people may feel drowsy or less alert when using these drugs. They should accordingly avoid driving or performing activities that require full attention. | No
2805 | NarrativeText | People diagnosed with kidney disease or liver disease may also be more sensitive to alpha blockers. They should inform their physicians about these conditions if alpha blockers are prescribed. Older people may also be more sensitive and may be more likely to have unwanted side effects, such as fainting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. | No
2806 | NarrativeText | It should be noted that alpha blockers do not cure high blood pressure. They simply help to keep the condi- tion under control. Similarly, these drugs will not shrink an enlarged prostate gland. Although they will help relieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement, the prostate may continue to grow, and it eventually may be necessary to have prostate surgery. | No

2852 | NarrativeText | Alport syndrome is diagnosed with a medical evalu- ation and family history, together with a kidney biopsy that can detect changes in the kidney typical of the condi- tion. Urinalysis may reveal blood or protein in the urine. Blood tests can reveal a low platelet level. | No
2853 | NarrativeText | In addition, tests for the Alport gene are now avail- able. Although testing is fairly expensive, it is covered by many types of health insurance. DNA tests can diagnose affected children even before birth, and genetic linkage tests tracing all family members at risk for Alport syn- drome are also available. | No
2854 | Title | Treatment | No
2855 | NarrativeText | There is no specific treatment that can “cure” Alport syndrome. Instead, care is aimed at easing the problems related to kidney failure, such as the presence of too many waste products in the blood (uremia). | No

2884 | NarrativeText | Altitude sickness is a general term encompassing a spectrum of disorders that occur at higher altitudes. Since the severity of symptoms varies with altitude, it is important to understand the range of the different alti- tudes that may be involved. High altitude is defined as height greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m); medium altitude is defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000 feet (1,524-2,438 m); and extreme altitude is defined as height greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majority of healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness when they reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20% of people ascending above 9,000 (2,743 m) feet in one day will develop altitude sickness. Children under six years and women in the premenstrual part of their cycles may be more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting medical conditions—even a minor respiratory infection—may become sick at more moderate altitudes. | No
2885 | Title | Description | No
2886 | NarrativeText | There are three major clinical syndromes that fall under the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). These syndromes are not separate, individual syndromes as much as they are a continuum of severity, all resulting from a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS is the mildest, and the other two represent severe, life-threatening forms of altitude sickness. | No
2887 | NarrativeText | Altitude sickness occurs because the partial pressure of oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pressure is a term applied to gases that is similar to the way the term concentration is applied to liquid solutions.) For instance, at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygen drops to one-half its value at sea level and, therefore, there is a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for the individual to inhale. This is known as hypoxia. Further- more, since there is less oxygen to inhale, less oxygen reaches the blood. This is known as hypoxemia. These two conditions are the major factors that form the basis for all the medical problems associated with altitude sickness. | No
2888 | NarrativeText | As a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural response is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate). This is the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapid rate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxia at higher altitudes is known as acclimatization, and it occurs during the first few days. Acclimatization is a response that occurs in individuals who travel from lower to higher altitudes. There are groups of people who have lived at high altitudes (for example, in the Himalayan and Andes mountains) for generations, and they are sim- ply accustomed to living at such altitudes, perhaps through a genetic ability. | No

2890 | NarrativeText | Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of altitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes higher greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m)—even 6,500 feet (1,981 m) in some susceptible individuals. Although hypoxia is associated with the development of AMS, the exact mech- anism by which this condition develops has yet to be con- firmed. It is important to realize that some individuals acclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than others. As aresult, under similar conditions some will suffer from AMS while others will not. At present, the susceptibility of otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS can- not be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer from AMS, the condition tends to be most severe on the second or third day after reaching the high altitude, and it usually abates after three to five days if they remain at the same altitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel to an even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a few hours to a few days following ascent, and they include dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, nausea, vomit- ing, loss of appetite, and insomnia. | No
2891 | NarrativeText | High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life- threatening condition that afflicts a small percentage of those who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid leaks from within the pulmonary blood vessels into the lung tissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within the lung tissue (pulmonary edema), the individual begins to | No

2899 | NarrativeText | Typically, the individual who suffers from HAPE ascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediate- ly develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, a cough productive of a large amount of sometimes bloody sputum, and a rapid rate of breathing. If no medical assis- tance is provided by this point, the patient goes into a coma and dies within a few hours. | No
2900 | NarrativeText | High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest and most severe form of altitude sickness, involves cerebral edema, and its mechanism of development is also poorly understood. The symptoms often begin with those of AMS, but neurologic symptoms such as an altered level of consciousness, speech abnormalities, severe headache, loss of coordination, hallucinations, and even seizures. If no intervention is implemented, death is the result. | No
2901 | Title | Diagnosis | No
2902 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made from the observation of the individual’s symptoms dur- ing travel to higher altitudes. | No
2903 | Title | Treatment | No
2904 | NarrativeText | Mild AMS requires no treatment other than an aspirin or ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of fur- ther ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because they may blunt the respiratory response, making it even more difficult for the person to breathe deeply and rapidly enough to compensate for the lower levels of oxygen in the environment. Oxygen may also be used to alleviate symptoms of mild AMS. | No
2905 | NarrativeText | As for HAPE and HACE, the most important course of action is descent to a lower altitude as soon as possi- ble. Even a 1,000-2,000 -foot (305-610 m) descent can dramatically improve one’s symptoms. If descent is not possible, oxygen therapy should be started. In addition, dexamethasone (a steroid) has been suggested in order to reduce cerebral edema. | No
2906 | Title | Prognosis | No
2907 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for mild AMS is good, if appropriate measures are taken. As for HAPE and HACE, the prog- nosis depends upon the rapidity and distance of descent and the availability of medical intervention. Descent often leads to improvement of symptoms, however, recovery times vary among individuals. | No
2908 | Title | Prevention | No
2909 | NarrativeText | When individuals ascend from sea level, it is recom- mended that they spend at least one night at an interme- diate altitude prior to ascending to higher elevations. In general, climbers should take at least two days to go from sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438 m). After reaching that point, healthy climbers should generally allow one day for each additional 2,000 feet (610 m), and one day of rest should be taken every two or three days. Should mild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent should be avoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individual should return to a lower altitude. Some reports indicate that acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken before ascent as a preventative measure for AMS. | No
2910 | NarrativeText | Paying attention to diet can also help prevent alti- tude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes, so climbers should drink ample water (enough to pro- duce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or clear urine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should be avoided. Eating frequent small, high-carbohydrate snacks (for example, fruits, jams and starchy foods) can help, especially in the first few days of climbing. | No

2920 | Title | Definition | No
2921 | NarrativeText | Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, a neurologic disease characterized by loss of mental ability severe enough to interfere with normal activities of daily living, lasting at least six months, and not present from birth. AD usually occurs in old age, and is marked by a decline in cognitive functions such as remembering, reasoning, and planning. | No
2922 | Title | Description | No
2923 | NarrativeText | A person with AD usually has a gradual decline in mental functions, often beginning with slight memory loss, followed by losses in the ability to maintain employment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and to reason and exercise judgment. Communication ability, mood, and personality may also be affected. Most people who have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis, although that interval may be as short as one year or as long as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death in adults after heart disease, cancer, and stroke. | No
2924 | NarrativeText | Between two and four million Americans have AD; that number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by the middle of the 21st century as the population as a whole ages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50s develop the disease (called early-onset AD), AD predomi- nantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all people between ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75 and 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly more women than men are affected with AD, but this may be because women tend to live longer, and so there is a higher proportion of women in the most affected age groups. | No
2925 | NarrativeText | The costs for caring for a person with AD is consid- erable. The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in 1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a patient with mild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and $36,100 for a patient with severe AD. The annual direct and indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the United States was estimated to be as much as $100 billion. Slightly more than half of AD patients are cared for at home, while the remainder are cared for in a variety of health care institutions. | No
2926 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
2927 | Title | Causes | No
2928 | NarrativeText | The cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are unknown. Some strong leads have been found through recent research, however, and these have also given some theoretical support to several new experimental treatments. | No
2929 | NarrativeText | At first AD destroys neurons (nerve cells) in parts of the brain that control memory, including the hippocam- pus, which is a structure deep in the deep that controls short-term memory. As these neurons in the hippocampus stop functioning, the short-term memory of the person fails, and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreases. Later AD affects the cerebral cortex, particularly the areas responsible for language and reasoning; this language skills are lost and the ability to make judgments is changed. Personality changes occur, which may include emotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever- ity of these changes increases with the progression of the disease. Eventually many other areas of the brain become involved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink and lose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid- den, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive. | No
2930 | NarrativeText | Autopsy of a person with AD shows that the regions of the brain affected by the disease become clogged with two abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted masses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. In AD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilize parts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twisted and tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons. Amyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta- amyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu- rons and non-nerve cells. Plaques are found in the spaces between the nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clear exactly how these structures cause problems, many researchers believe that their formation is responsible for the mental changes of AD, presumably by interfering with the normal communication between neurons in the brain and later leading to the death of neurons. As of 2000, three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They act by increasing the level of chemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu- rotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica- tion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl- cholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released by neurons that is necessary for cognitive function. These drugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’s ability to perform normal activities of daily living. | No
2931 | NarrativeText | What triggers the formation of plaques and tangles and the development of AD are unknown. AD likely results from many interrelated factors, including genetic, environmental, and others not yet identified. Two types of AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso- mal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, with no obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described in terms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring in people younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those 65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 of AD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some cases of early on-set AD are inherited and are common in some families. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than the more common late-on-set type. | No
2932 | NarrativeText | All FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that have been identified so far are the early on-set type. As many as 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by three genes located on three different chromosomes. Some families have mutations in the APP gene located on chro- mosome 21, which causes the production of abnormal APP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre- senilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes the production of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and others have mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat- ed on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor- mal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymes that clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be important in the synaptic connections between brain cells. | No
2933 | NarrativeText | There is no evidence that the mutated genes that cause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, but genetics does appear to play a role in this more common ‘orm of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer- sity in the early 1990s, potentially the most important genetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene on this chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codes or a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons. APOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), called APOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inherits one APOE from each parent, and therefore can either have one copy of two different forms, or two copies of one. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect some people from AD, as it seems to be associated with a ower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD does develop. APOE e3 is the most common version found in the general population, and only appears to have a neu- tral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increase the risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritance of one or two copies of APOE e4. Compared to those without APOE e4, people with one copy are about three times as likely to develop late-onset AD, and those with two copies are almost four times as likely to do so. Hav- ing APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as much as 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk of developing AD and does not cause it, as not everyone with APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it can still have the disease. Why APOE e4 increases the chances of developing AD is not known with certainty. However, one theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta- amyloid buildup in plaques, thus contributing to the low- ering of the age of onset of AD; other theories involve cell death independent of its effects on plaque buildup. In 2000, four new AD-related regions in the human genome were identified, where one out of several hundred genes in each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD. These genes, which are not yet identified, appear to make a contribution to the risk of developing late-onset AD that is at least as important as APOE e4. | No
2934 | NarrativeText | Other non-genetic factors have also been studied in relation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the brain may play a role in development of AD, and use of nons- teroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to reduce the risk of developing AD. Restriction of blood flow may be part of the problem, perhaps accounting for the beneficial effects of estrogen, which increases blood flow in the brain, among its other effects. Highly reactive molecular fragments called free radicals damage cells of all kinds, especially brain cells, which have smaller sup- plies of protective antioxidants thought to protect against free radical damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant, and its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit. | No
2935 | NarrativeText | While the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are still unknown, there are several risk factors that increase a person’s likelihood of developing the dis- ease. The most significant one is, of course, age; older people develop AD at much higher rates than younger ones. There is some evidence that strokes and AD may be linked, with small strokes that go undetected clinically contributing to the injury of neurons. Blood cholesterol levels may also be important. Scientists have shown that high blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of geneti- cally engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rate of plaque deposition. There are also parallels between AD and other progressive neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia, including prion diseases, Parkin- son’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. | No
2936 | NarrativeText | Numerous epidemiological studies of populations are also being conducted to learn more about whether and to what extent early life events, socioeconomic factors, and ethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. For example, results from one study indicated that rural resi- dence in childhood, along with fewer than six years of schooling, was associated with increased AD risk. How- ever, the low educational attainment that was identified as arisk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other dele- terious socioeconomic or environmental influences in childhood, thus illustrating the difficulties in interpreting epidemiological findings, due to the complexity of the issues and the large number of variables involved. | No
2937 | NarrativeText | Many environmental factors have been suspected of contributing to AD, but epidemiological population stud- ies have not borne out these links. Among these have been pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from com- mercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none of these factors has been shown to cause AD or increase its likelihood. Further research may yet turn up links to other environmental factors. | No
2938 | Title | Symptoms | No
2939 | NarrativeText | The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradu- ally, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memory lapses are of course common to everyone, and do not by themselves signify any change in cognitive function. The person with AD may begin with only the routine sort of memory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—but progress to more profound or disturbing losses, such as forgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becoming lost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhood becomes more likely as the disease progresses. A person with AD may forget the names of family members, or forget what was said at the beginning of a sentence by the time he hears the end. | No
2940 | NarrativeText | As AD progresses, other symptoms appear, includ- ing inability to perform routine tasks, loss of judgment, and personality or behavior changes. Some patients have trouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita- tion in the evening (“sunsetting” or Sundowner’s Syn- drome). In some cases, people with AD repeat the same ideas, movements, words, or thoughts, a behavior known as perseveration. In the final stages people may have severe problems with eating, communicating, and con- trolling their bladder and bowel functions. | No
2941 | NarrativeText | The Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of ten warning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp- toms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation: * memory loss that affects job skills + difficulty performing familiar tasks | No
2942 | ListItem | * problems with language + disorientation of time and place | No
2943 | ListItem | * poor or decreased judgment * problems with abstract thinking | No
2944 | ListItem | ¢ misplacing things * changes in mood or behavior | No
2945 | ListItem | * changes in personality + loss of initiative | No
2946 | NarrativeText | Other types of dementia, including some that are reversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is important for the person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a pro- fessional who can weigh the possibility that his or her symptoms may have another cause. Approximately 20% of those originally suspected of having AD turn out to have some other disorder; about half of these cases are treatable. | No
2947 | Title | Diagnosis | No
2948 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is complex, and may require office visits to several different specialists over several months before a diagnosis can be made. While a confident provisional diagnosis may be made in most cases after thorough testing, AD cannot be defini- tively diagnosed until autopsy examination of the brain for plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. | No
2949 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough physi- cal exam and complete medical history. Except in the disease’s earliest stages, accurate history from family members or caregivers is essential. Since there are both prescription and over-the-counter drugs that can cause the same mental changes as AD, a careful review of the patient’s drug, medicine, and alcohol use is important. AD-like symptoms can also be provoked by other med- ical conditions, including tumors, infection, and demen- tia caused by mild strokes (multi-infarct dementia). These possibilities must be ruled out as well through appropriate blood and urine tests, brain magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans, tests of the brain’s electrical activity (electroencephalographs or EEGs), or other tests. Several types of oral and written tests are used to aid in the AD diagnosis and to follow its progression, including tests of mental status, functional abilities, memory, and concen- tration. Still, the neurologic exam is normal in most patients in early stages. | No
2950 | NarrativeText | One of the most important parts of the diagnostic process is to evaluate the patient for depression and delirium, since each of these can be present with AD, or may be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves a decreased consciousness or awareness of one’s environ- ment.) Depression and memory loss are both common in the elderly, and the combination of the two can often be mistaken for AD. Depression can be treated with drugs, although some antidepressants can worsen dementia if it is present, further complicating both diag- nosis and treatment. | No
2951 | NarrativeText | An early and accurate diagnosis of AD is important in developing strategies for managing symptoms and for helping patients and their families planning for the future and pursuing care options while the patient can still take part in the decision-making process. | No
2952 | NarrativeText | A genetic test for the APOE e4 gene is available, but is not used for diagnosis, since possessing even two copies does not ensure that a person will develop AD. In addition, access to genetic information could affect the insurability of a patient if disclosed, and also affect employment status and legal rights. | No

2954 | Title | Treatment | No
2955 | NarrativeText | Alzheimer’s disease is presently incurable, so there- fore the mainstay of treatment for a person with AD is good nursing care, providing both physical and emotion- al support for a person who is gradually able to do less and less for himself, and whose behavior is becoming more and more erratic. Modifications of the home to increase safety and security are often necessary. The caregiver also needs support to prevent anger, despair, and burnout from becoming overwhelming. Becoming familiar with the issues likely to lie ahead, and consider- ing the appropriate financial and legal issues early on, can help both the patient and family cope with the diffi- cult process of the disease. Regular medical care by a practitioner with a non-defeatist attitude toward AD is important so that illnesses such as urinary or respiratory infections can be diagnosed and treated properly, rather than being incorrectly attributed to the inevitable decline seen in AD. | No
2956 | NarrativeText | People with AD are also often depressed or anxious, and may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition, and general poor health. Each of these conditions is treatable to some degree. It is important for the person with AD to eat well and continue to exercise. Professional advice rom a nutritionist may be useful to provide healthy, easy-to-prepare meals. Finger foods may be preferable to those requiring utensils to be eaten. Regular exercise (supervised if necessary for safety) promotes overall health. A calm, structured environment with simple ori- entation aids (such as calendars and clocks) may reduce anxiety and increase safety. Other psychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there), and delusions (false beliefs) may be treated with drugs if necessary. | No
2957 | Title | Drugs | No
2958 | NarrativeText | As of 2000, only three drugs—tacrine (Cognex), donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept), and rivastigmine (Exelon)—have been approved by the FDA for its treat- ment. Tacrine has been shown to be effective for improv- ing memory skills, but only in patients with mild-to-mod- erate AD, and even then in less than half of those who take it. Its beneficial effects are usually mild and temporary, but it may delay the need for nursing home admission. The most significant side effect is an increase in a liver enzyme known as alanine aminotransferase, or ALT. Patients tak- ing tacrine must have a weekly blood test to monitor their ALT levels. Other frequent side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion, and skin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per month in early 1998, with additional costs for the weekly blood monitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine appears to be cost-effective for those who respond to it, since it may decrease the number of months a patient needs nursing care. Donepezil is the drug most commonly used to treat mild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helps some patients for periods of time ranging from months to about two years. Donepezil has two advantages over tacrine: it has fewer side effects, and it can be given once daily rather than three times daily. Donepezil does not appear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does not require weekly blood tests. The frequency of abdominal side effects is also lower. The monthly cost is approxi- mately the same. Rivastigmine, approved for use in April of 2000, has been shown to improve the ability of patients to carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing, decrease behavioral symptoms such as delusions and agi- tation, and improve cognitive functions such as thinking, memory, and speaking. The cost is similar to those of the other two drugs. However, none of these three drugs stops Estrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely pre- scribed for post-menopausal women to prevent osteo- porosis. Several preliminary studies have shown that women taking estrogen have lower rates of AD, and those who develop AD have a slower progression and less severe symptoms.However, estrogen does not appear to have a beneficial effect on women who already have AD. | No
2959 | NarrativeText | Preliminary studies have also suggested a reduced risk for developing AD in older people who regularly use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ- ing aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, although not aceta- minophen.Inflammation of the brain is a distinctive char- acteristic of AD, but whether it is a cause or an effect of the disease is not yet known. | No
2960 | NarrativeText | Antioxidants, which act to inhibit and protect against oxidative damage caused by free radicals, have | No
2961 | Title | 138 | No
2962 | NarrativeText | been shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in tis- sue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted to see whether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD. | No
2963 | NarrativeText | Another antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought to delay AD onset. It is not yet clear whether this is due to the specific action of vitamin E on brain cells, or to an increase in the overall health of those taking it. | No
2964 | NarrativeText | Drugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics, and sedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptoms (agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep disorders) of AD. Research is being conducted to search for better treatments, including non-drug approaches for AD patients. | No
2965 | Title | Nursing care and safety | No
2966 | NarrativeText | The person with Alzheimer’s disease will gradually lose the ability to dress, groom, feed, bathe, or use the toilet by himself; in the later stages of the disease, he may be unable to move or speak. In addition, the per- son’s behavior becomes increasing erratic. A tendency to wander may make it difficult to leave him unattended for even a few minutes and make even the home a potentially dangerous place. In addition, some patients may exhibit inappropriate sexual behaviors. | No
2967 | NarrativeText | The nursing care required for a person with AD is well within the abilities of most people to learn. The dif- ficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant but unpredictable nature of the demands put on them. In addition, the personality changes undergone by a person with AD can be heartbreaking for family members, as a loved one deteriorates, seeming to become a different person. Not all AD patients develop negative behaviors: some become quite gentle, and spend increasing amounts of time in dreamlike states. | No
2968 | NarrativeText | A loss of good grooming may be one of the early symptoms of AD. Mismatched clothing, unkempt hair, and decreased interest in personal hygiene become more common. Caregivers, especially spouses, may find these changes socially embarrassing and difficult to cope with. The caregiver will usually need to spend increasing amounts of time for grooming to compensate for the loss of attention from the patient, although some adjustment of expectations (while maintaining cleanliness) is often needed as the disease progresses. | No
2969 | NarrativeText | Proper nutrition is important for a person with AD, and may require assisted feeding early on, to make sure the person is taking in enough nutrients. Later on, as move- ment and swallowing become difficult, a feeding tube may be placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. A feeding tube requires more attention, but is generally easy to care for if the patient is not resistant to its use. | No
2970 | NarrativeText | For many caregivers, incontinence becomes the most difficult problem to deal with at home, and is a principal reason for pursuing nursing home care. In the early stages, limiting fluid intake and increasing the fre- quency of toileting can help. Careful attention to hygiene is important to prevent skin irritation and infection from soiled clothing. | No
2971 | NarrativeText | Persons with dementia must deal with six basic safe- ty concerns: injury from falls, injury from ingesting dan- gerous substances, leaving the home and getting lost, injury to self or others from sharp objects, fire or burns, and the inability to respond rapidly to crisis situations. In all cases, a person diagnosed with AD should no longer be allowed to drive, because of the increased potential for accidents and the increased likelihood of wandering very far from home while disoriented. In the home, sim- ple measures such as grab bars in the bathroom, bed rails on the bed, and easily negotiable passageways can great- ly increase safety. Electrical appliances should be unplugged and put away when not in use, and matches, lighters, knives, or weapons should be stored safely out of reach. The hot water heater temperature may be set lower to prevent accidental scalding. A list of emergency numbers, including the poison control center and the hospital emergency room, should be posted by the phone. As the disease progresses, caregivers need to peri- odically reevaluate the physical safety of the home and introduce new strategies for continued safety. | No
2972 | Title | Care for the caregiver | No
2973 | NarrativeText | Family members or others caring for a person with AD have an extremely difficult and stressful job, which becomes harder as the disease progresses. Dementia caregivers spend significantly more time on caregiving than do people providing care for those with other types of illnesses. This type of caregiving also has a greater impact in terms of employment complications, caregiver strain, mental and physical health problems, time for leisure and other family members, and family conflict than do other types of caregiving. It is common for AD caregivers to develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt, and hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow they feel for their loved one and for themselves. Depression is an extremely common consequence of being a full-time caregiver for a person with AD. Support groups are an important way to deal with the stress of caregiving. Becoming a member of an AD caregivers’ support group can be one of the most important things a family member does, not only for him or herself, but for the person with AD as well. The location and contact numbers for AD caregiver support groups are available from the Alzheimer’s Association; they may also be available through a local social service agency, the patient’s physi- cian, or pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the drugs used to treat AD. Medical treatment for depression may be an important adjunct to group support. | No
2974 | Title | Outside help, nursing homes, and governmental assistance | No
2975 | NarrativeText | Most families eventually need outside help to relieve some of the burden of around-the-clock care for a person with AD.

2976 | NarrativeText | Providing the total care required by a person with late-stage AD can become an overwhelming burden for a family, even with outside help. At this stage, many fami- lies consider nursing home care. This decision is often one of the most difficult for the family, since it is often seen as an abandonment of the loved one and a failure of the fami- ly. Careful counseling with a sympathetic physician, cler- gy, or other trusted adviser may ease the difficulties of this transition. Selecting a nursing home may require a difficult balancing of cost, services, location, and availability. Keeping the entire family involved in the decision may help prevent further stress from developing later on. | No
2977 | NarrativeText | Several federal government programs may ease the cost of caring for a person with AD, including Social Security Disability, Medicare, and Supplemental Securi- ty Income. Each of these programs may provide some assistance for care, medication, or other costs, but none of them will pay for nursing home care indefinitely. Medicaid is a state-funded program that may provide for some or all of the cost of nursing home care, although there are important restrictions. Details of the benefits and eligibility requirements of these programs are avail- able through the local Social Security or Medicaid office, or from local social service agencies. | No

3016 | NarrativeText | Amblyopia is an uncorrectable decrease in vision in one or both eyes with no apparent structural abnormality seen to explain it. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that when a decrease in vision is detected, other causes must be ruled out. Once no other cause is found, ambly- opia is the diagnosis. Generally, a difference of two lines or more (on an eye-chart test of visual acuity) between the two eyes or a best corrected vision of 20/30 or worse would be defined as amblyopia. For example, if someone has 20/20 vision with the right eye and only 20/40 with the left, and the left eye cannot achieve better vision with corrective lenses, the left eye is said to be amblyopic. | No
3017 | Title | Description | No
3018 | NarrativeText | Lazy eye is a common non-medical term used to describe amblyopia because the eye with poorer vision doesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia is the most common cause of impaired vision in children, affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or 2-4% of the population. Vision is a combination of the clarity of the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the process- ing of those images by the brain. If the images produced by the two eyes are substantially different, the brain may not be able to fuse the images. Instead of seeing two dif- ferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup- presses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead to amblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferring one eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop- ment in the blurrier eye. | No

3021 | ListItem | ¢ Strabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) is the most common cause of functional amblyopia. The two eyes are looking in two different directions at the same time. The brain is sent two different images and this causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or “crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision. | No
3022 | ListItem | Anisometropia. This is another type of functional amblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac- tive states between the two eyes (in other words, a dif- ference of prescriptions between the two eyes). For example, one eye may be more nearsighted than the other eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the other eye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the two dissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrier image, causing the eye to become amblyopic. | No
3023 | ListItem | Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the image to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain “prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataract may become amblyopic. | No

3036 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3037 | NarrativeText | Because children with outwardly normal eyes may have amblyopia, it is important to have regular vision screenings performed for all children. While there is some controversy regarding the age children should have their first vision examination, their eyes can, in actuality, be examined at any age, even at one day of life. | No
3038 | NarrativeText | Some recommend that children have their vision checked by their pediatrician, family physician, ophthal- mologist, or optometrist at or before six months of age. Others recommend testing by at least the child’s fourth birthday. There may be a “critical period” in the develop- ment of vision, and amblyopia may not be treatable after age eight or nine. The earlier amblyopia is found, the better the possible outcome. Most physicians test vision as part of achild’s medical examination. If there is any sign of an eye problem, they may refer a child to an eye specialist. | No
3039 | NarrativeText | There are objective methods, such as retinoscopy, to measure the refractive status of the eyes. This can help determine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a hand-held instrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (or infant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescrip- tion can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determined using a variety of methods. Many different eye charts are available (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or letters).

Sometimes visual fields to determine defects in the area of vision will be performed. Color vision testing may also be performed. Again, it must be emphasized that ambly- opia is a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threatening problems can also cause a decrease in vision. An exami- nation of the eyes and visual system is very important when there is an unexplained decrease in vision. | No
3042 | Title | Treatment | No
3043 | NarrativeText | The primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion therapy. It is important to alternate patching the good eye (forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the amblyopic eye. If the good eye is constantly patched, it too may become amblyopic because of disuse. The treatment plan should be discussed with the doctor to fully understand how long the patch will be on. When patched, eye exercis- es may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focus and work. This is called vision therapy or vision training (eye exercises). Even after vision has been restored in the weak eye, part-time patching may be required over a peri- od of years to maintain the improvement. | No
3044 | NarrativeText | While patching is necessary to get the amblyopic eye to work, it is just as important to correct the reason for the amblyopia. Glasses may also be worn if there are errors in refraction. Surgery or vision training may be necessary in the case of strabismus. Better nutrition is indicated in some toxic amblyopias. Occasionally, amblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the good eye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use the amblyopic eye. | No
3045 | Title | Prognosis | No
3046 | NarrativeText | The younger the person, the better the chance for improvement with occlusion and vision therapy. Howev- er, treatment may be successful in older children—even adults. Success in the treatment of amblyopia also depends upon how severe the amblyopia is, the specific type of amblyopia, and patient compliance. It is impor- tant to diagnose and treat amblyopia early because sig- nificant vision loss can occur if left untreated. The best outcomes result from early diagnosis and treatment. | No
3047 | Title | Prevention | No
3048 | NarrativeText | To protect their child’s vision, parents must be aware of amblyopia as a potential problem. This awareness may encourage parents to take young children for vision exams early on in life—certainly before school age. Proper nutri- tion is important in the avoidance of toxic amblyopia. | No

3059 | NarrativeText | Amebiasis is an infectious disease caused by a para- sitic one-celled microorganism (protozoan) called Enta- moeba histolytica. Persons with amebiasis may experi- ence a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea, fever, and cramps. The disease may also affect the intestines, liver, or other parts of the body. | No
3060 | Title | Description | No
3061 | NarrativeText | Amebiasis, also known as amebic dysentery, is one of the most common parasitic diseases occurring in humans, with an estimated 500 million new cases each year. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropical areas where living conditions are crowded, with inade- quate sanitation. Although most cases of amebiasis occur in persons who carry the disease but do not exhibit any symptoms (asymptomatic), as many as 100,000 people die of amebiasis each year. In the United States, between 1 and 5% of the general population will develop amebia- sis in any given year, while male homosexuals, migrant workers, institutionalized people, and recent immigrants develop amebiasis at a higher rate. | No
3062 | NarrativeText | Human beings are the only known host of the amebi- asis organism, and all groups of people, regardless of age or sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primarily spread in food and water that has been contaminated by human feces but is also spread by person-to-person con- tact. The number of cases is typically limited, but region- al outbreaks can occur in areas where human feces are used as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with water sup- plies contaminated with human feces. | No

3064 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
3065 | NarrativeText | Recently, it has been discovered that persons with symptom-causing amebiasis are infected with Entamoe- ba histolytica, and those individuals who exhibit no symptoms are actually infected with an almost identical- looking ameba called Entamoeba dispar. During their life cycles, the amebas exist in two very different forms: the infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move but can survive outside the human body because of its protective covering, and the disease-producing form, the trophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot infect others. The disease is most commonly transmitted when a person eats food or drinks water containing E. histolytica cysts from human feces. In the digestive tract the cysts are transported to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile trophozoites. Once released within the intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the large intestine. Within the lining of the large intestine, the trophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinal tissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped sore (ulcer). The trophozoites may remain inside the intestine, in the intestinal wall, or may break through the intestinal wall and be carried by the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, or other organs. Trophozoites that remain in the intestines eventually form new cysts that are carried through the digestive tract and excreted in the feces. Under favorable temperature and humidity conditions, the cysts can sur- vive in soil or water for weeks to months, ready to begin the cycle again. | No
3066 | NarrativeText | Although 90% of cases of amebiasis in the United States are mild, pregnant women, children under two years of age, the elderly, malnourished individuals, and people whose immune systems may be compressed, such as cancer or AIDS patients and those individuals taking prescription medications that suppress the immune sys- tem, are at a greater risk for developing a severe infection. | No
3067 | NarrativeText | The signs and symptoms of amebiasis vary accord- ing to the location and severity of the infection and are classified as follows: Intestinal amebiasis Intestinal amebiasis can be subdivided into several categories: ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION. Most persons with amebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even though these individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable of infecting others by person-to-person contact or by conta- minating food or water with cysts that others may ingest, for example, by preparing food with unwashed hands. | No
3068 | NarrativeText | CHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Individu- als may experience symptoms over a long period of time during a chronic amebiasis infection and experience recurrent episodes of diarrhea that last from one to four weeks and recur over a period of years. These patients may also suffer from abdominal cramps, fatigue, and weight loss. | No
3069 | NarrativeText | AMEBIC DYSENTERY. In severe cases of intestinal amebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the intes- tine, producing sores (ulcers), bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal cramps, vomiting, chills, and fevers as high as 104-105°F (40-40.6°C). In addition, a case of acute ame- bic dysentery may cause complications, including inflammation of the appendix (appendicitis), a tear in the intestinal wall (perforation), or a sudden, severe inflammation of the colon (fulminating colitis). | No
3070 | NarrativeText | AMEBOMA. An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the bowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It can result from either chronic intestinal infection or acute amebic dysentery. Amebomas may produce symptoms that mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases. | No

3072 | Title | Extraintestinal amebiasis | No
3073 | NarrativeText | Extraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximate- ly 10% of all reported amebiasis cases and includes all forms of the disease that affect other organs. | No
3074 | NarrativeText | The most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis is amebic abscess of the liver. In the United States, ame- bic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young His- panic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result from direct infection of the liver by E. histolytica or as a com- plication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an amebic abscess of the liver complain of pain in the chest or abdomen, fever, nausea, and tenderness on the right side directly above the liver. | No
3075 | NarrativeText | Other forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, though rare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity, brain, or genitals. These are extremely serious and have a rela- tively high mortality rate. | No
3076 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3077 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partly because the disease can affect several areas of the body and can range from exhibiting few, if any, symptoms to being severe, or even life-threatening. In most cases, a physician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when a patient has a combination of symptoms, in particular, diarrhea and a possible history of recent exposure to amebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons, or anal intercourse. | No
3078 | NarrativeText | It is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and another disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that produces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed incor- rectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can encourage the growth and spread of the amebiasis organism. Because of the serious consequences of misdiagnosis, potential cases of IBD must be confirmed with multiple stool samples and blood tests, and a procedure involving a visual inspection of the intestinal wall using a thin lighted, tubu- lar instrument (sigmoidoscopy) to rule out amebiasis. | No
3079 | NarrativeText | A diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by one or more tests, depending on the location of the disease. | No
3080 | Title | Stool examination | No
3081 | NarrativeText | This test involves microscopically examining a stool sample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of E. histolytica and not one of the many other intestinal ame- bas that are often found but that do not cause disease. A series of three stool tests is approximately 90% accurate in confirming a diagnosis of amebic dysentery. Unfortu- nately, however, the stool test is not useful in diagnosing amebomas or extraintestinal infections. | No
3082 | Title | Sigmoidoscopy | No
3083 | NarrativeText | Sigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in which a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a sig- moidoscope, is used to visually examine the lower part of the large intestine for amebic ulcers and take tissue or fluid samples from the intestinal lining. | No
3084 | Title | Blood tests | No
3085 | NarrativeText | Although tests designed to detect a specific protein produced in response to amebiasis infection (antibody) are capable of detecting only about 10% of cases of mild ame- biasis, these tests are extremely useful in confirming 95% of dysentery diagnoses and 98% of liver abscess diag- noses. Blood serum will usually test positive for antibody within a week of symptom onset. Blood testing, however, cannot always distinguish between a current or past infec- tion since the antibodies may be detectable in the blood for as long as 10 years following initial infection. | No
3086 | Title | maging studies | No
3087 | NarrativeText | A number of sophisticated imaging techniques, such as computed tomography scans (CT), magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, can be used to determine whether a liver abscess is present. Once locat- ed, a physician may then use a fine needle to withdraw a sample of tissue to determine whether the abscess is indeed caused by an amebic infection. | No
3088 | Title | Treatment | No
3089 | NarrativeText | Asymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis may require no treatment. However, because of the potential for disease spread, amebiasis is generally treated with a medication to kill the disease-causing amebas. More severe cases of amebic dysentery are additionally treated by replacing lost fluid and blood. Patients with an ame- bic liver abscess will also require hospitalization and bed rest. For those cases of extraintestinal amebiasis, treat- ment can be complicated because different drugs may be required to eliminate the parasite, based on the location of the infection within the body. Drugs used to treat ame- biasis, called amebicides, are divided into two categories: Luminal amebicides These drugs get their name because they act on organisms within the inner cavity (lumen) of the bowel. They include diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, metronida- zole, and paromomycin. | No
3090 | Title | Tissue amebicides | No
3091 | NarrativeText | Tissue amebicides are used to treat infections in the liver and other body tissues and include emetine, dehy- droemetine, metronidazole, and chloroquine. Because these drugs have potentially serious side effects, patients given emetine or dehydroemetine require bed rest and heart monitoring. Chloroquine has been found to be the most useful drug for treating amebic liver abscess. Patients taking metronidazole must avoid alcohol because the drug-alcohol combination causes nausea, vomiting, and headache. | No

3122 | NarrativeText | The absence of menstrual periods is called amenor- rhea. Primary amenorrhea is the failure to start having a period by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is more common and refers to either the temporary or permanent ending of periods in a woman who has menstruated nor- mally in the past. Many women miss a period occasional- ly. Amenorrhea occurs if a woman misses three or more periods in a row. | No
3123 | Title | Description | No
3124 | NarrativeText | The absence of menstrual periods is a symptom, not a disease. While the average age that menstruation begins is 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary amenor- rhea in the United States is just 2.5%. | No
3125 | NarrativeText | Some female athletes who participate in rowing, long distance running, and cycling, may notice a few missed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk for developing amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnasts, who typically exercise strenuously and eat poorly. | No
3126 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
3127 | NarrativeText | Amenorrhea can have many causes. Primary amenor- rhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances, psychi- atric disorders, eating disorders, malnutrition, excessive thinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body fat content too low, and excessive physical conditioning. Intense physical training prior to puberty can delay menarche (the onset of menstruation). Every year of training can delay menar- che for up to five months. Some medications such as anti- depressants, tranquilizers, steroids, and heroin can induce amenorrhea. | No
3128 | Title | Primary amenorrhea | No
3129 | NarrativeText | However, the main cause is a delay in the beginning of puberty either from natural reasons (such as heredity or poor nutrition) or because of a problem in the endocrine system, such as a pituitary tumor or hypothyroidism. An obstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus may be the presenting indications of an underlying metabolic, endocrine, congenital or gynecological disorder. | No
3130 | NarrativeText | Typical causes of primary amenorrhea include: * excessive physical activity + drastic weight loss (such as occurs in anorexia or bulimia) | No
3131 | ListItem | * extreme obesity + drugs (antidepressants or tranquilizers) | No
3132 | ListItem | + chronic illness * turner’s syndrome. (A chromosomal problem in place at birth, relevant only in cases of primary amenorrhea) | No
3133 | ListItem | « the absence of a vagina or a uterus * imperforate hymen (lack of an opening to allow the menstrual blood through) | No
3134 | Title | Secondary amenorrhea | No
3135 | NarrativeText | Some of the causes of primary amenorrhea can also cause secondary amenorrhea—strenuous physical activi- ty, excessive weight loss, use of antidepressants or tran- quilizers, in particular. In adolescents, pregnancy and stress are two major causes. Missed periods are usually caused in adolescents by stress and changes in environ- ment. Adolescents are especially prone to irregular peri- ods with fevers, weight loss, changes in environment, or increased physical or athletic activity. However, any ces- sation of periods for four months should be evaluated. | No
3136 | NarrativeText | The most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea is pregnancy. Also, a woman’s periods may halt temporarily after she stops taking birth control pills. This temporary halt usually lasts only for a month or two, though in some cases it can last for a year or more. Secondary amenor- thea may also be related to hormonal problems related to stress, depression, anorexia nervosa or drugs, or it may be caused by any condition affecting the ovaries, such as a tumor. The cessation of menstruation also occurs perma- nently after menopause or a hysterectomy. | No
3137 | NarrativeText | Polycystic ovary syndrome is another common cause of secondary amenorrhea. It is caused by ovaries contain- ing many fluid filled sacs (cysts) with abnormal levels of male hormones (androgens). This condition is related to improper functioning of the pituitary gland, as it releases hormones necessary for pregnancy (leuteinizing hor- mones), and can cause women to develop male characteris- tics, such as acne and coarse body hair. If the condition is not treated, some of the androgens may convert to estrogen, and chronically high levels of estrogen may increase the chance of developing cancer of the uterine lining. | No
3138 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3139 | NarrativeText | It may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea, but the exam should start with a pregnancy test; pregnan- cy needs to be ruled out whenever a woman’s period is two to three weeks overdue. Androgen excess, estrogen deficiency, or other problems with the endocrine system need to be checked. Prolactin in the blood and the thy- roid stimulating hormone (TSH) should also be checked. | No
3140 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis usually includes a patient history and a physical exam (including a pelvic exam). If a woman has missed three or more periods in a row, a physician may recommend blood tests to measure hormone levels, a scan of the skull to rule out the possibility of a pituitary tumor, and ultrasound scans of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out a tumor of the adrenal gland or ovary. | No
3141 | Title | Treatment | No
3142 | NarrativeText | Treatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause. Pri- mary amenorrhea often requires no treatment, but it’s always important to discover the cause of the problem in any case. Not all conditions can be treated, but any underlying condition that is treatable should be treated. | No
3143 | NarrativeText | If a hormonal imbalance is the problem, proges- terone for one to two weeks every month or two may cor- rect the problem. With polycystic ovary syndrome, birth control pills are often prescribed. A pituitary tumor is treated with bromocriptine, a drug that reduces certain hormone (prolactin) secretions. Weight loss may bring on a period in an obese woman. Easing up on excessive exercise and eating a proper diet may bring on periods in teen athletes. In very rare cases, surgery may be needed for women with ovarian or uterine cysts. | No
3144 | Title | Prognosis | No
3145 | NarrativeText | Prolonged amenorrhea can lead to infertility and other medical problems such as osteoporosis (thinning of the bones). If the halt in the normal period is caused by stress or illness, periods should begin again when the stress pass- es or the illness is treated. Amenorrhea that occurs with dis- continuing birth control pills usually go away within six to eight weeks, although it may take up to a year. | No
3146 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for polycystic ovary disease depends on the severity of the symptoms and the treatment plan. Spironolactone, a drug that blocks the production of male hormones, can help in reducing body hair. If a woman wishes to become pregnant, treatment with clomiphene may be required or, on rare occasions, surgery on the ovaries. | No
3147 | Title | Prevention | No
3148 | NarrativeText | Primary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condi- tion cannot be prevented. In general, however, women should maintain a healthy diet, with plenty of exercise, rest, and not too much stress, avoiding smoking and sub- stance abuse. Female athletes should be sure to eat a bal- anced diet and rest and exercise normally. However, many cases of amenorrhea cannot be prevented. | No

3172 | Title | Purpose | No
3173 | NarrativeText | Amino acid disorder screening is done in newborns, and sometimes children and adults, to detect inborn errors in metabolism of amino acids. Twenty of the 100 known amino acids are the main building blocks for human proteins. Proteins regulate every aspect of cellular | No

3175 | NarrativeText | function. Of these 20 amino acids, ten are not made by the body and must be acquired through diet. Congenital (present at birth) enzyme deficiencies that affect amino acid metabolism or congenital abnormalities in the amino acid transport system of the kidneys creates a con- dition called aminoaciduria. | No
3176 | NarrativeText | Screening is especially important in newborns. Some congenital amino acid metabolic defects cause mental retardation that can prevented with prompt treatment of the newborn. One of the best known exam- ples of this is phenylketonuria (PKU). This is an genetic error in metabolism of phenylalanine, an amino acid found in milk. Individuals with PKU do not produce the enzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine. | No
3177 | NarrativeText | PKU occurs in about one out of 16,000 live births in the United States, but is more prevalent in caucasians and less prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews and African Americans. Newborns in the United States are routinely screened for PKU by a blood test. | No
3178 | NarrativeText | There are two types of aminoacidurias. Primary or overflow aminoaciduria results from deficiencies in the enzymes necessary to metabolize amino acids. Overflow aminoaciduria is best detected by a blood plasma test. | No
3179 | NarrativeText | Secondary or renal aminoaciduria occurs because of a congenital defect in the amino acid transport system in the tubules of the kidneys. This produces increased amino acids in the urine. Blood and urine test in combi- nation are used to determine if the aminoaciduria is of the overflow or renal type. Urine tests are also used to monitor specific amino acid disorders. | No
3180 | NarrativeText | Newborns are screened for amino acid disorders. Young children with acidosis (accumulation of acid in the body), severe vomiting and diarrhea, or urine with an abnormal color or odor, are also screened with a urine test for specific amino acid levels. | No
3181 | Title | Precautions | No
3182 | NarrativeText | Both blood and urine tests are simple tests that can be done in a doctor’s office or clinic. These tests can be done on even the youngest patients. | No
3183 | Title | Description | No
3184 | NarrativeText | Two types of amino acid screening tests are used together to diagnose amino acid disorders. | No
3185 | Title | Blood plasma screening | No
3186 | NarrativeText | In the blood test, a medical technician draws a small amount of blood from a baby’s heel. The procedure is rapid and relatively painless. Total time for the test is less than ten minutes. The blood is sent to a laboratory where results will be available in about two days. | No
3187 | Title | Urine test | No
3188 | NarrativeText | In the urine test, the patient is asked to urinate into a collecting cup. For an infant, the urine is collected in a pedi- atric urine collector. The process is painless. The length of time the test takes is determined by how long it takes the patient to urinate. Results also take about two days. | No
3189 | NarrativeText | Both these tests use thin layer chromatography to separate the amino acids present. Using this technique, the amino acids form a characteristic patterns on a glass plate coated with a thin layer of silica gel. This pattern is then compared to the normal pattern to determine if there are abnormalities. | No
3190 | Title | Preparation | No
3191 | NarrativeText | Before the blood test, the patient must not eat or drink for four hours. Failure to fast will alter the results of the test. | No
3192 | NarrativeText | The patient should eat and drink normally before the urine test. Some drugs may affect the results of the urine test. The technician handling the urine sample should be informed of any medications the patient is taking. Moth- ers of breastfeeding infants should report any medica- tions they are taking, since these can pass from mother to child in breast milk. | No
3193 | Title | Aftercare | No
3194 | NarrativeText | The blood screening is normally done first. Depend- ing on the results, it is followed by the urine test. It takes both tests to distinguish between overflow and renal aminoaciduria. Also, if the results are abnormal, a 24- hour urine test is performed along with other tests to determine the levels of specific amino acids. In the event of abnormal results, there are many other tests that will be performed to determine the specific amino acid involved in the abnormality. | No
3195 | Title | Risks | No
3196 | NarrativeText | There are no particular risks associated with either of these tests. Occasionally minor bruising may occur at the site where the blood was taken. | No

3219 | NarrativeText | Aminoglycosides are a group of antibiotics that are used to treat certain bacterial infections. This group of antibiotics includes at least eight drugs: amikacin, gen- tamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, paro- momycin, streptomycin, and tobramycin. All of these drugs have the same basic chemical structure. | No
3220 | Title | Purpose | No
3221 | NarrativeText | Aminoglycosides are primarily used to combat infec- tions due to aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. These bacte- ria can be identified by their reaction to Gram’s stain. In Gram’s staining, a film of material containing the possible bacteria is placed on a glass slide and dried. The slide is stained with crystal violet for one minute, cleaned off with water and then placed into a solution of Gram’s iodine solution for one minute. The iodine solution is rinsed off and the slide is immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol. The slide is then stained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safranine for 30 seconds, rinsed in water, dried and examined. Gram- positive bacteria retain the violet purple stain. Gram-nega- tive bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria that can success- fully be combated with aminoglycosides include Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter species, among others. Aminoglycosides are also effective against mycobacteria, the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis. | No
3222 | NarrativeText | The aminoglycosides can be used against certain Gram-positive bacteria, but are not typically employed because other antibiotics are more effective and have fewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that cannot grow in the presence of oxygen), viruses, and fungi. And only one aminoglycoside, paromomycin, is used against para- sitic infection. | No
3223 | NarrativeText | Like all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are not effective against influenza, the common cold, or other viral infections. | No
3224 | Title | Precautions | No
3225 | NarrativeText | Pre-existing medical conditions—such as kidney dis- ease, eighth cranial nerve disease, myasthenia gravis, and Parkinson’s disease—should be discussed prior to taking any aminoglycosides. Pregnant women are usually advised against taking aminoglycosides, because their infants may suffer damage to their hearing, kidneys, or sense of bal- ance. However, those factors need to be considered along- side the threat to the mother’s health and life in cases of serious infection. Aminoglycosides do not pass into breast milk to any great extent, so nursing mothers may be pre- scribed aminoglycosides without injuring their infants. | No
3226 | Title | Description | No
3227 | NarrativeText | Streptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was isolated from Streptomyces griseus in the mid-1940s. This antibiot- ic was very effective against tuberculosis. One of the main drawbacks to streptomycin is its toxicity, especially to cells in the inner and middle ear and the kidney. Furthermore, some strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment with streptomycin. Therefore, medical researchers have put con- siderable effort into identifying other antibiotics with strep- tomycin’s efficacy, but without its toxicity. | No
3228 | NarrativeText | Aminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from the gastrointestinal tract; in fact, aminoglycosides taken oral- ly are excreted virtually unchanged and undiminished in quantity. The route of drug administration depends on the type and location of the infection being treated. The typi- cal routes of administration are by intramuscular (injec- tion into a muscle) or intravenous injection (injection into a vein), irrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation. If the infection being treated involves the central nervous system, the drug can be injected into the spinal canal. | No
3229 | NarrativeText | The bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has not been fully explained. It is known that the drug attaches to a bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the cell via chan- nels made up of the protein, porin. Once inside the cell, the aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s ribosomes. Ribosomes are the intracellular structures responsible for manufacturing proteins. This attachment either shuts down protein production or causes the cell to produce abnormal, ineffective proteins. The bacterial cell cannot survive with this impediment. | No
3230 | NarrativeText | Antibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may pair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually a beta-lactam or vancomycin, administered separately. Beta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cell wall, making it more porous. The increased porosity allows more of the aminoglycoside into the bacteria cell. | No
3231 | NarrativeText | Traditionally, aminoglycosides were administered at even doses given throughout the day. It was thought that a steady plasma concentration was necessary to combat infection. However, this administration schedule is time and labor intensive. Furthermore, administering a single daily dose can be as effective, or more effective, than several doses throughout the day. | No
3232 | NarrativeText | Dosage depends on the patient’s age, weight, gender, and general health. Since the drug is cleared by the kid- neys, it is important to assess any underlying problems with kidney function. Kidney function is assessed by measuring the blood levels of creatinine, a protein nor- mally found in the body. If these levels are high, it is an indication that the kidneys may not be functioning at an optimal rate and dosage will be lowered accordingly. | No
3233 | Title | Risks | No
3234 | NarrativeText | Aminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic to cer- tain cells in the ears and in the kidneys. Approximately 5- 10% of the people who are treated with aminoglycosides experience some side effect, affecting their hearing, sense of balance, or kidneys. However, in most cases the dam- age is minor and reversible once medication is stopped. | No
3235 | NarrativeText | If cells in the inner ear are damaged or destroyed, an individual may experience a loss of balance and feelings of dizziness. Damage to the middle ear may result in hearing loss or tinnitus. Neomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin are the most likely to cause problems with hearing, and streptomycin and gentamicin carry the greatest risk of causing vertigo and loss of balance. Kid- ney damage, apparent with changes in urination frequen- cy or urine production, is most likely precipitated by neomycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin. | No
3236 | NarrativeText | Young children and the elderly are at the greatest risk of suffering side effects. Excessive dosage or poor clearance of the drug from the body can be injurious at any age. | No
3237 | NarrativeText | Less common side effects include skin rashes and itching. Very rarely, certain aminoglycosides may cause difficulty in breathing, weakness, or drowsiness. Gen- tamicin, when injected, may cause leg cramps, skin rash, fever, or seizures. | No
3238 | NarrativeText | If side effects linger or become worse after medica- tion is stopped, it is advisable to seek medical advice. Side effects that may be of concern include tinnitus or loss of hearing, dizziness or loss of balance, changes in urination frequency or urine production, increased thirst, appetite loss, and nausea or vomiting. | No
3239 | Title | Normal results | No
3240 | NarrativeText | At the proper dosage and in the presence of gram- negative enteric (intestinal) bacteria, aminoglycosides are very effective in treating an infection. | No
3241 | Title | Abnormal results | No
3242 | NarrativeText | In some cases, bacteria are resistant to antibiotics that would normally kill them. This resistance becomes apparent after repeated exposure to the antibiotic and arises from a mutation that alters the bacteria’s suscepti- bility to the drug. Various degrees of resistance have been observed in bacteria that normally would be destroyed by aminoglycosides. In general, though, aminoglycoside effectiveness has held up well over time. | No

3266 | NarrativeText | People who experience amnesia have been instrumen- tal in helping brain researchers determine how the brain processes memory.

Memory of new experi- ences, motor skills, past events, and previous conditioning were grouped together in one system that relied on a spe- cific area of the brain. | No
3267 | NarrativeText | If all memory were stored in the same way, it would be reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brain area would cause complete memory loss. However, stud- ies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such research demonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for pro- cessing, storing, and drawing on memory. | No
3268 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
3269 | NarrativeText | Amnesia has several root causes. Most are traceable to brain injury related to physical trauma, disease, infec- tion, drug and alcohol abuse, or reduced blood flow to the brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, for example, damage to the memory centers of the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri- tion. Infections that damage brain tissue, including encephalitis and herpes, can also cause amnesia. If the amnesia is thought to be of psychological origin, it is termed psychogenic. | No
3270 | NarrativeText | There are at least three general types of amnesia: + Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain trau- ma and is characterized by the inability to remember new information. Recent experiences and short-term memory disappear, but victims can recall events prior to the trauma with clarity. | No
3271 | ListItem | * Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is the opposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can recall events that occurred after a trauma, but cannot remem- ber previously familiar information or the events pre- ceding the trauma. | No
3272 | ListItem | ¢ Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has no consistently identifiable cause, but researchers have suggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacks may be the trigger. (A transient ischemic attack, sometimes called “a small stroke,’ occurs when a blockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood sup- ply to part of the brain.) A victim experiences sudden confusion and forgetfulness. Attacks can be as brief as 30-60 minutes or can last up to 24 hours. In severe attacks, a person is completely disoriented and may experience retrograde amnesia that extends back sever- al years. While very frightening for the patient, tran- sient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno- sis for recovery. | No
3273 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3274 | NarrativeText | In diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look at several factors. During a physical examination, the doc- tor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug and medication history, and checks the patient’s general health. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter- mine the extent of amnesia and the memory system affected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reveal whether the brain has been damaged, and blood work to exclude treatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances. | No
3275 | Title | Treatment | No
3276 | NarrativeText | Treatment depends on the root cause of amnesia and is handled on an individual basis. Regardless of cause, cognitive rehabilitation may be helpful in learning strategies to cope with memory impairment. | No

Others, such as Korsakoff syn- drome, associated with prolonged alcohol abuse or amnesias caused by severe brain injury, may be perma- nent. Depending on the degree of amnesia and its cause, victims may be able to lead relatively normal lives. Amnesiacs can learn through therapy to rely on other memory systems to compensate for what is lost. | No

3302 | NarrativeText | Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose fetal defects in the early second trimester of pregnancy. A sample of the amniotic fluid, which surrounds a fetus in the womb, is collected through a pregnant woman’s abdomen using a needle and syringe. Tests performed on fetal cells found in the sample can reveal the presence of many types of genetic disorders, thus allowing doctors and prospective parents to make important decisions about early treatment and intervention. | No
3303 | Title | Purpose | No
3304 | NarrativeText | Since the mid-1970s, amniocentesis has been used routinely to test for Down syndrome, by far the most common, nonhereditary, genetic birth defect, afflicting about one in every 1,000 babies. By 1997, approximately 800 different diagnostic tests were available, most of them for hereditary genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, muscular dys- trophy and cystic fibrosis. | No
3305 | NarrativeText | Amniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommended for women who will be older than 35 on their due-date. It is also recommended for women who have already borne children with birth defects, or when either of the parents has a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos- tic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is to confirm indications of Down syndrome and certain other defects which may have shown up previously during rou- tine maternal blood screening. | No
3306 | NarrativeText | The risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary genetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly relat- ed to a woman’s age—the older the woman, the greater the risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to begin amnio testing because that is the age at which the risk of carrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals the risk of miscarriage caused by the procedure—about one in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a child with this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45 it increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg- nant women over 35 in the United States undergo amniocentesis and many younger women also decide to have the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all Down syndrome infants born in the United States each year are to women younger than 35. | No
3307 | NarrativeText | One of the most common reasons for performing amniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetus and present in the mother’s blood. A simple blood screening, usually conducted around the 15th week of pregnancy, can determine the AFP levels in the mother’s blood. Levels that are too high or too low may signal possible fetal defects. Because this test has a high false- positive rate, another test such as amnio is recommended whenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range. | No
3308 | NarrativeText | Amniocentesis is generally performed during the 16th week of pregnancy, with results usually available within three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio as early as the 11th week but this is not usually recommend- ed because there appears to be an increased risk of mis- carriage when done at this time. The advantage of early amnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for deci- sion making if a problem is detected. Potential treatment of the fetus can begin earlier. Important, also, is the fact | No
3309 | Title | 154 | No
3310 | NarrativeText | that elective abortions are safer and less controversial the earlier they are performed. | No
3311 | Title | Precautions | No
3312 | NarrativeText | As an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a real, although small, risk to the health of a fetus. Parents must weigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, or indeed the reassurance that all is well, against the small risk of damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. The serious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse test results can bring must also be considered. The decision to undergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice. | No
3313 | Title | Description | No
3314 | NarrativeText | The word amniocentesis literally means “puncture of the amnion,” the thin-walled sac of fluid in which a developing fetus is suspended during pregnancy. During the sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts a very fine needle through the woman’s abdomen into the uterus and amniotic sac and withdraws approximately one ounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The relatively pain- less procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, some- times using local anesthesia. | No
3315 | NarrativeText | The physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee- dle placement and collect the sample, thereby minimiz- ing the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated nee- dle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the woman can return home after a brief observation period. She may be instructed to rest for the first 24 hours and to avoid heavy lifting for two days. | No
3316 | NarrativeText | The sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratory where fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated and grown in order to provide enough genetic material for testing. This takes about seven to 14 days. The material is then extracted and treated so that visual examination for defects can be made. For some disorders, like Tay-Sachs, the simple presence of a telltale chemical compound in the amniotic fluid is enough to confirm a diagnosis. Depending on the specific tests ordered, and the skill of the lab conducting them, all the results are available between one and four weeks after the sample is taken. | No
3317 | NarrativeText | Cost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the lab, and the tests ordered. Most insurers provide coverage for women over 35, as a follow-up to positive maternal blood screening results, and when genetic disorders run in the family. | No
3318 | NarrativeText | An alternative to amnio, now in general use, is chori- onic villus sampling, or CVS, which can be performed as early as the eighth week of pregnancy. While this allows for the possibility of a first trimester abortion, if warrant- ed, CVS is apparently also riskier and is more expensive. | No

3322 | NarrativeText | It is important for a woman to fully understand the procedure and to feel confident in the obstetrician per- forming it. Evidence suggests that a physician’s experi- ence with the procedure reduces the chance of mishap. Almost all obstetricians are experienced in performing amniocentesis.

3334 | NarrativeText | Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)—A procedure simi- lar to amniocentesis, except that cells are taken from the chorionic membrane for testing. These cells, called chorionic villus cells, eventually become the placenta. The samples are collected either through the abdomen, as in amnio, or through the vagina. CVS can be done earlier in the pregnancy than amnio, but carries a somewhat higher risk. | No
3335 | NarrativeText | Hereditary—Something which is inherited—passed down from parents to offspring. In biology and medicine, the word pertains to inherited genetic characteristics. | No
3336 | NarrativeText | Maternal blood screening—Maternal blood screen- ing is normally done early in pregnancy to test for a variety of conditions.

3391 | NarrativeText | Before an amputation is performed, extensive testing is done to determine the proper level of amputation. The goal of the surgeon is to find the place where healing is most likely to be complete, while allowing the maximum amount of limb to remain for effective rehabilitation. | No
3392 | NarrativeText | Details of the operation vary slightly depending on what part is to be removed.

3402 | NarrativeText | After amputation, medication is prescribed for pain, and patients are treated with antibiotics to discourage infection. The stump is moved often to encourage good circulation. Physical therapy and rehabilitation are started as soon as possible, usually within 48 hours. Studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between early rehabilitation and effective functioning of the stump and prosthesis. Length of stay in the hospital depends on the severity of the amputation and the general health of the amputee, but ranges from several days to two weeks. | No
3403 | NarrativeText | Rehabilitation is a long, arduous process, especially for above the knee amputees. Twice daily physical thera- py is not uncommon. In addition, psychological counsel- ing is an important part of rehabilitation. Many people feel a sense of loss and grief when they lose a body part. Others are bothered by phantom limb syndrome, where they feel as if the amputated part is still in place. They may even feel pain in this limb that does not exist. Many amputees benefit from joining self-help groups and meeting others who are also living with amputation. Addressing the emotional aspects of amputation often speeds the physical rehabilitation process. | No
3404 | Title | Risks | No
3405 | NarrativeText | Amputation is major surgery. All the risks associated with the administration of anesthesia exist, along with the possibility of heavy blood loss and the development of blood clots. Infection is of special concern to amputees. Infection rates in amputations average 15%. If the stump becomes infected, it is necessary to remove the prosthesis and sometimes to amputate a second time at a higher level. | No

3424 | NarrativeText | Amylase is a digestive enzyme made primarily by the pancreas and salivary glands. Enzymes are sub- stances made and used by the body to trigger specific chemical reactions. The primary function of the enzyme amylase is to break down starches in food so that they can be used by the body. Amylase testing is usually done to determine the cause of sudden abdominal pain. | No
3425 | Title | Purpose | No
3426 | NarrativeText | Amylase testing is performed to diagnose a number of diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis, for example, is the most common reason for a high amylase level. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase escapes from the pancreas into the blood. Within six to 48 hours after the pain begins, amylase levels in the blood start to rise. Levels will stay high for several days before gradu- ally returning to normal. | No
3427 | NarrativeText | There are other causes of increased amylase. An ulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes into the pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the blood. During a mumps infection, amylase from the inflamed salivary glands increases. Amylase is also found in the liver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine; inflammation of these tissues also increases levels. Gall bladder disease, tumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol poisoning, ruptured aortic aneurysm, and intestinal strangulation or perfora- tion can also cause unusually high amylase levels. | No
3428 | Title | Precautions | No
3429 | NarrativeText | This is not a screening test for future pancreatic dis- ease. | No
3430 | Title | Description | No
3431 | NarrativeText | Amylase testing is done on both blood and urine. The laboratory may use any of several testing methods that involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a sub- stance with which amylase is known to react. By measur- ing the end-product or the reaction time, technicians can calculate the amount of amylase present in the sample. More sophisticated methods separately measure the amy- lase made by the pancreas and the amylase made by the salivary glands. | No
3432 | NarrativeText | Urine testing is a better long-term monitor of amy- lase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra amylase from the blood into the urine. Urine levels rise six to 10 hours after blood levels and stay high longer. Urine is | No

3435 | Title | Preparation | No
3436 | NarrativeText | In most cases, no special preparation is necessary for a person undergoing an amylase blood test. Patients taking longer term urine amylase tests will be given a container and instructions for collecting the urine at home. The urine should be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory. | No
3437 | Title | Aftercare | No
3438 | NarrativeText | Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc- ture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Apply- ing warm packs to the puncture site relieves discomfort. | No

3440 | NarrativeText | Normal results vary based on the laboratory and the method used. | No
3441 | Title | Abnormal results | No
3442 | NarrativeText | Eight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis will have high amylase levels, up to four times the normal level. Other causes of increased amylase, such as mumps, kidney failure, pregnancy occurring in the abdomen but outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy), certain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain complications of diabetes, and advanced pancreatic cancer, are further investigated based on the person’s symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests. | No
3443 | NarrativeText | In kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient at removing amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in the blood, but stays at normal levels in the urine. | No
3444 | NarrativeText | People with macroamylasia have large clumps of amylase in their blood. These clumps are too large to move through the kidney, so they stay in the blood. Amy- lase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the urine will be low. | No
3445 | NarrativeText | Amylase levels may be low in severe liver disease (including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreas fails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions (pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build up in the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), following burns, in thyroid disorders, and in advanced cystic fibrosis. Some medications can raise or lower levels. | No

3460 | NarrativeText | Amyloidosis is a progressive, incurable, metabolic disease characterized by abnormal deposits of protein in one or more organs or body systems. | No
3461 | Title | Description | No
3462 | NarrativeText | Amyloid proteins are manufactured by malfunction- ing bone marrow. Amyloidosis, which occurs when accu- mulated amyloid deposits impair normal body function, can cause organ failure or death. It is a rare disease, occurring in about eight of every 1,000,000 people. It affects males and females equally and usually develops after the age of 40. At least 15 types of amyloidosis have been identified. Each one is associated with deposits of a different kind of protein. | No
3463 | Title | Types of amyloidosis | No
3464 | NarrativeText | The major forms of this disease are primary sys- temic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloidosis. There is also another form of amyloidosis associated with Alzheimer’s disease. | No
3465 | NarrativeText | Primary systemic amyloidosis usually develops between the ages of 50 and 60. With about 2,000 new cases diagnosed annually, primary systemic amyloidosis is the most common form of this disease in the United States. Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, it may also occur in association with multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer). | No
3466 | NarrativeText | Secondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infec- tion or inflammatory disease. It is often associated with: ¢ familial Mediterranean fever (a bacterial infection characterized by chills, weakness, headache, and recurring fever) | No

3470 | ListItem | ¢ rheumatoid arthritis Familial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only inher- ited form of the disease. It occurs in members of most ethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive pattern of symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary amyloi- dosis is though to be autosomal dominant, which means that only one copy of the defective gene is necessary to cause the disease. A child of a parent with familial amy- loidosis has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease. | No
3471 | NarrativeText | Amyloidosis can involve any organ or system in the body. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, and nervous system are affected most often. Other common sites of amyloid accumulation include the brain, joints, liver, spleen, pancreas, respiratory system, and skin. | No
3472 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
3473 | NarrativeText | The cause of amyloidosis is unknown. Most patients have gastrointestinal abnormalities, but other symptoms vary according to the organ(s) or system(s) affected by the disease. Usually the affected organs are rubbery, firm, and enlarged. | No
3474 | Title | Heart | No
3475 | NarrativeText | Because amyloid protein deposits can limit the heart’s ability to fill with blood between beats, even the slightest exertion can cause shortness of breath. If the heart’s electrical system is affected, the heart’s rhythm may become erratic. The heart may also be enlarged and heart murmurs may be present. Congestive heart fail- ure may result. | No

3483 | Title | Nervous system | No
3484 | NarrativeText | Nervous system symptoms often appear in patients with familial amyloidosis. Inflammation and degenera- tion of the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy) may be present. One of four patients with amyloidosis has carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful disorder that causes numbness or tingling in response to pressure on nerves around the wrist. Amyloidosis that affects nerves to the feet can cause burning or numbness in the toes and soles and eventually weaken the legs. If nerves control- ling bowel function are involved, bouts of diarrhea alternate with periods of constipation. If the disease affects nerves that regulate blood pressure, patients may feel dizzy or faint when they stand up suddenly. | No
3485 | Title | Liver and spleen | No
3486 | NarrativeText | The most common symptoms are enlargement of these organs. Liver function is not usually affected until quite late in the course of the disease. Protein accumula- tion in the spleen can increase the risk of rupture of this organ due to trauma. | No
3487 | Title | Gastrointestinal system | No
3488 | NarrativeText | The tongue may be inflammed, enlarged, and stiff. Intestinal movement (motility) may be reduced. Absorp- tion of food and other nutrients may be impaired (and may lead to malnutrition), and there may also be bleed- ing, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. | No
3489 | Title | Skin | No
3490 | NarrativeText | Skin symptoms occur in about half of all cases of primary and secondary amyloidosis and in all cases where there is inflammation or degeneration of the peripheral nerves. Waxy-looking raised bumps (papules) | No
3491 | Title | 162 | No
3492 | NarrativeText | may appear on the face and neck, in the groin, armpits, or anal area, and on the tongue or in the ear canals. Swelling, hemorrhage beneath the skin (purpura), hair loss, and dry mouth may also occur. | No

3495 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3496 | NarrativeText | Blood and urine tests can reveal the presence of amyloid protein, but tissue or bone-marrow biopsy is necessary to positively diagnose amyloidosis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, additional laboratory tests and imaging procedures are performed to determine: * which type of amyloid protein is involved ¢ which organ(s) or system(s) have been affected | No
3497 | ListItem | + how far the disease has progressed | No
3498 | Title | Treatment | No
3499 | NarrativeText | The goal of treatment is to slow down or stop pro- duction of amyloid protein, eliminate existing amyloid deposits, alleviate underlying disorders (that give rise to secondary amyloidosis), and relieve symptoms caused by heart or kidney damage. Specialists in cardiology, hema- tology (the study of blood and the tissues that form it), nephrology (the study of kidney function and abnormali- ties), neurology (the study of the nervous system), and rheumatology (the study of disorders characterized by inflammation or degeneration of connective tissue) work together to assess a patient’s medical status and evaluate the effects of amyloidosis on every part of the body. | No
3500 | NarrativeText | Colchicine (Colebenemid, Probeneaid), prednisone, (Prodium), and other anti-inflammatory drugs can slow or stop disease progression. Bone-marrow and stem-cell transplants can enable patients to tolerate higher and more effective doses of melphalan (Alkeran) and other chemotherapy drugs prescribed to combat this non- malignant disease. Surgery can relieve nerve pressure and may be performed to correct other symptom-produc- ing conditions. Localized amyloid deposits can also be removed surgically. Dialysis or kidney transplantation can lengthen and improve the quality of life for patients whose amyloidosis results in kidney failure. Heart trans- plants are rarely performed. | No
3501 | Title | Supportive measures | No
3502 | NarrativeText | Although no link has been established between diet and development of amyloid proteins, a patient whose heart or kidneys have been affected by the disease may be advised to use a diuretic or follow a low-salt diet. | No
3503 | Title | Prognosis | No
3504 | NarrativeText | Most cases of amyloidosis are diagnosed after the disease has reached an advanced stage. The course of each patient’s illness is unique but death, usually a result of heart disease or kidney failure, generally occurs within a few years. Amyloidosis associated by multiple myelo- ma usually has a poor prognosis. Most patients with both diseases die within one to two years. | No

3518 | NarrativeText | Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that breaks down tissues in the nervous system (a neurode- generative disease) of unknown cause that affects the nerves responsible for movement. It is also known as motor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease, after the baseball player whose career it ended. | No
3519 | Title | Description | No
3520 | NarrativeText | ALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve cells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (upper motor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheral nerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle move- ment. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these neurons die, | No
3521 | NarrativeText | leading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtual- ly any of the muscles in the body. ALS affects “volun- tary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought, such as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and of itself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, the heart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys- tem, bladder, and other internal organs. Most people with ALS retain function of their eye muscles as well. Howev- er, various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss of intellectual function (dementia) or sensory symptoms. | No
3522 | NarrativeText | “Amyotrophic” refers to the loss of muscle bulk, a cardinal sign of ALS. “Lateral” indicates one of the regions of the spinal cord affected, and “sclerosis” describes the hardened tissue that develops in place of healthy nerves. ALS affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States, with about 5,000 new cases each year. It usually begins between the ages of 40 and 70, although younger onset is possible. Men are slightly more likely to develop ALS than women. | No
3523 | NarrativeText | ALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatal within three years for 50% of all people affected, and within five years for 80%. Ten percent of people with ALS live beyond eight years. | No
3524 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
3525 | Title | Causes | No
3526 | NarrativeText | The symptoms of ALS are caused by the death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Normally, these neurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the muscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk, neck, and head. As motor neurons die, the muscles they enervate cannot be moved as effectively, and weakness results. In addition, lack of stimulation leads to muscle wasting, or loss of bulk. Involvement of the upper motor neurons causes spasms and increased tone in the limbs, and abnormal reflexes. Involvement of the lower motor neurons causes muscle wasting and twitching (fasciculations). | No
3527 | NarrativeText | Although many causes of motor neuron degenera- tion have been suggested for ALS, none has yet been proven responsible. Results of recent research have implicated toxic molecular fragments known as free radi- cals. Some evidence suggests that a cascade of events leads to excess free radical production inside motor neu- rons, leading to their death. Why free radicals should be produced in excess amounts is unclear, as is whether this excess is the cause or the effect of other degenerative processes. Additional agents within this toxic cascade may include excessive levels of a neurotransmitter known as glutamate, which may over-stimulate motor neurons, thereby increasing free-radical production, and a faulty detoxification enzyme known as SOD-1, for | No

These neurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the muscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk, neck, and head. As motor neurons degenerate, the muscles are weakened and cannot move as effectively, leading to muscle wasting. (I/lustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.) | No
3530 | NarrativeText | superoxide dismutase type 1. The actual pathway of destruction is not known, however, nor is the trigger for the rapid degeneration that marks ALS. Further research may show that other pathways are involved, perhaps ones even more important than this one. Autoimmune factors or premature aging may play some role, as could viral agents or environmental toxins. | No
3531 | NarrativeText | Sporadic ALS has no known cause. While many environmental toxins have been suggested as causes, to date no research has confirmed any of the candidates investigated, including aluminum and mercury and lead from dental fillings. As research progresses, it is likely that many cases of sporadic ALS will be shown to have a genetic basis as well. | No
3532 | NarrativeText | Two major forms of ALS are known: familial and sporadic. Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all ALS cases. As the name suggests, familial ALS is believed to be caused by the inheritance of one or more faulty genes. About 15% of families with this type of ALS have muta- tions in the gene for SOD-1. SOD-1 gene defects are dom- inant, meaning only one gene copy is needed to develop the disease. Therefore, a parent with the faulty gene has a 50% chance of passing the gene along to a child. | No
3533 | NarrativeText | A third type, called Western Pacific ALS, occurs in Guam and other Pacific islands. This form combines symptoms of both ALS and Parkinson’s disease. | No
3534 | Title | Symptoms | No
3535 | NarrativeText | The earliest sign of ALS is most often weakness in the arms or legs, usually more pronounced on one side than the other at first. Loss of function is usually more | No
3536 | Title | 164 | No
3537 | NarrativeText | rapid in the legs among people with familial ALS and in the arms among those with sporadic ALS. Leg weakness may first become apparent by an increased frequency of stumbling on uneven pavement, or an unexplained diffi- culty climbing stairs. Arm weakness may lead to difficul- ty grasping and holding a cup, for instance, or loss of dexterity in the fingers. | No
3538 | NarrativeText | Less often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness in the bulbar muscles, those muscles in the mouth and throat that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking. A person with bulbar weakness may become hoarse or tired after speaking at length, or speech may become slurred. | No
3539 | NarrativeText | In addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs of ALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching (fascic- ulation). These are usually seen after weakness becomes obvious. Fasciculation is quite common in people without the disease, and is virtually never the first sign of ALS. | No
3540 | NarrativeText | While initial weakness may be limited to one region, ALS almost always progresses rapidly to involve virtually all the voluntary muscle groups in the body. Later symp- toms include loss of the ability to walk, to use the arms and hands, to speak clearly or at all, to swallow, and to hold the head up. Weakness of the respiratory muscles makes breathing and coughing difficult, and poor swallowing con- trol increases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva (aspi- ration). Aspiration increases the likelihood of lung infec- tion, which is often the cause of death. With a ventilator and scrupulous bronchial hygiene, a person with ALS may live much longer than the average, although weakness and wasting will continue to erode any remaining functional abilities. Most people with ALS continue to retain function of the extraocular muscles that move their eyes, allowing some communication to take place with simple blinks or through use of a computer-assisted device. | No
3541 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3542 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete med- ical history and physical exam, plus a neurological exam- ination to determine the distribution and extent of weak- ness. An electrical test of muscle function, called an elec- tromyogram, or EMG, is an important part of the diag- nostic process. Various other tests, including blood and urine tests, x rays, and CT scans, may be done to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms, such as tumors of the skull base or high cervical spinal cord, thyroid dis- ease, spinal arthritis, lead poisoning, or severe vitamin deficiency. ALS is rarely misdiagnosed following a care- ful review of all these factors. | No

3551 | NarrativeText | which can be done, however, to help maintain quality of life and to retain functional ability even in the face of progressive weakness. | No
3552 | NarrativeText | As of early 1998, only one drug had been approved for treatment of ALS. Riluzole (Rilutek) appears to pro- vide on average a three-month increase in life expectancy when taken regularly early in the disease, and shows a significant slowing of the loss of muscle strength. Rilu- zole acts by decreasing glutamate release from nerve ter- minals. Experimental trials of nerve growth factor have not demonstrated any benefit. No other drug or vitamin currently available has been shown to have any effect on the course of ALS. | No
3553 | NarrativeText | A physical therapist works with an affected person and family to implement exercise and stretching pro- grams to maintain strength and range of motion, and to promote general health. Swimming may be a good choice for people with ALS, as it provides a low-impact workout to most muscle groups. One result of chronic inactivity is contracture, or muscle shortening. Contrac- tures limit a person’s range of motion, and are often painful. Regular stretching can prevent contracture. Sev- eral drugs are available to reduce cramping, a common complaint in ALS. | No
3554 | NarrativeText | An occupational therapist can help design solutions to movement and coordination problems, and provide advice on adaptive devices and home modifications. | No
3555 | NarrativeText | Speech and swallowing difficulties can be mini- mized or delayed through training provided by a speech- language pathologist. This specialist can also provide advice on communication aids, including computer- assisted devices and simpler word boards. | No
3556 | Title | sclerosis | No
3557 | NarrativeText | Nutritional advice can be provided by a nutritionist. A person with ALS often needs softer foods to prevent jaw exhaustion or choking. Later in the disease, nutri- tion may be provided by a gastrostomy tube inserted into the stomach. | No
3558 | NarrativeText | Mechanical ventilation may be used when breathing becomes too difficult. Modern mechanical ventilators are small and portable, allowing a person with ALS to main- tain the maximum level of function and mobility. Ventila- tion may be administered through a mouth or nose piece, or through a tracheostomy tube. This tube is inserted through a small hole made in the windpipe. In addition to providing direct access to the airway, the tube also decreases the risk aspiration. While many people with rapidly progressing ALS choose not to use ventilators for lengthy periods, they are increasingly being used to pro- long life for a short time. | No
3559 | NarrativeText | The progressive nature of ALS means that most per- sons will eventually require full-time nursing care. This care is often provided by a spouse or other family mem- ber. While the skills involved are not difficult to learn, the physical and emotional burden of care can be over- whelming. Caregivers need to recognize and provide for their own needs as well as those of people with ALS, to prevent depression, burnout, and bitterness. | No
3560 | NarrativeText | Throughout the disease, a support group can provide important psychological aid to affected persons and their caregivers as they come to terms with the losses ALS inflicts. Support groups are sponsored by both the ALS Society and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. | No
3561 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
3562 | NarrativeText | Given the grave prognosis and absence of tradition- al medical treatments, it is not surprising that a large number of alternative treatments have been tried for ALS. Two studies published in 1988 suggested that amino-acid therapies may provide some improvement for some people with ALS. While individual reports claim benefits for megavitamin therapy, herbal medi- cine, and removal of dental fillings, for instance, no evi- dence suggests that these offer any more than a brief psychological boost, often followed by a more severe letdown when it becomes apparent the disease has con- tinued unabated. However, once the causes of ALS are better understood, alternative therapies may be more intensively studied. For example, if damage by free radi- cals turns out to be the root of most of the symptoms, antioxidant vitamins and supplements may be used more routinely to slow the progression of ALS. Or, if environmental toxins are implicated, alternative thera- pies with the goal of detoxifying the body may be of some use. | No
3563 | Title | 166 | No
3564 | Title | Prognosis | No
3565 | NarrativeText | ALS usually progresses rapidly, and leads to death from respiratory infection within three to five years in most cases. The slowest disease progression is seen in those who are young and have their first symptoms in the limbs. About 10% of people with ALS live longer than eight years. | No

3599 | NarrativeText | An anaerobic infection is an infection caused by bacteria (called anaerobes) which cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can infect deep wounds, deep tissues, and internal organs where there is little oxygen. These infections are characterized by abscess formation, foul-smelling pus, and tissue destruction. | No
3600 | Title | Description | No
3601 | NarrativeText | Anaerobic means “life without air.” Anaerobic bac- teria grow in places which completely, or almost com- pletely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on the skin. Commonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteria include gas gangrene, tetanus, and botulism. Nearly all dental infections are caused by anaerobic bacteria. | No
3602 | NarrativeText | Anaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a normal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall) is damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually, the immune system kills any invading bacteria, but sometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause an infection. Body sites that have tissue destruction (necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygen and favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The low oxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease, shock, injury, and surgery. | No
3603 | NarrativeText | Anaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically anywhere in the body. For example: * Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the root canals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat, sinuses, and ears. | No

3609 | ListItem | * Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in the bloodstream of ill patients (a condition called bac- teremia). | No
3610 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
3611 | NarrativeText | People who have experienced shock, injury, or surgery, and those with blood vessel disease or tumors are at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacte- ria. There are many different kinds of anaerobic bacteria which can cause an infection. Indeed, most anaerobic infections are “mixed infections” which means that there is a mixture of different bacteria growing. The anaerobic bacteria that most frequently cause infections are Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, and Clostridium species. | No
3612 | NarrativeText | The signs and symptoms of anaerobic infection can vary depending on the location of the infection. In general, anaerobic infections result in tissue destruc- KEY TERMS Abscess—A lump filled with pus resulting from an infection. | No

3620 | ListItem | ¢ Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are red, painful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling pus. Skin infection causes localized swelling, pain, redness, and possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer) which drains foul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections may cause extensive tissue destruction (necrosis). | No

3622 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3623 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri- marily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history, and location of the infection. A foul-smelling infection or drainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobic infection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic bac- teria and occurs in one third to one half of patients late in the infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection include tissue necrosis and gas production at the infection site. A sample from the infected site may be obtained, using a swab or a needle and syringe, to determine which bacte- ria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bacteria can be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in the laboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples. | No
3624 | Title | 168 | No
3625 | NarrativeText | The recent medical history of the patient is helpful in diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has or recently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vessel disease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. The failure to improve following treatment with antibiotics that aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that the infection is caused by anaerobes. The location and type of infection also help in the diagnosis. | No
3626 | NarrativeText | Diagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if bacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look at internal infections. | No
3627 | Title | Treatment | No
3628 | NarrativeText | Serious infections may require hospitalization for treatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobic infections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identify the bacteria causing the infection and also which antibi- otic will work best. Every antibiotic does not work against all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes are killed by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metronida- zole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem (Primaxin). Other antibiotics which may be used are clindamycin (Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin). | No
3629 | NarrativeText | Surgical removal or drainage of the abscess is almost always required. This may involve drainage by needle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin abscess (called “aspiration”). The area would be numbed prior to the aspiration procedure. Also, some internal abscesses can be drained using this procedure with the help of ultrasound (a device which uses sound waves to visualize internal organs). This type of abscess drainage may be performed in the doctor’s office. | No
3630 | Title | Prognosis | No
3631 | NarrativeText | Complete recovery should be achieved with the appropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment. Untreated or uncontrolled infections can cause severe tissue and bone destruction, which would require plastic surgery to repair. Serious infections can be life threatening. | No

3642 | NarrativeText | There are basically two kinds of anal atresia. In boys with high anal atresia, there may be a channel (fistula) connecting the large intestine to either the urethra (which delivers urine from the bladder) or the bladder itself. In girls, the channel may connect with the vagina. Sixty percent of children with high anal atresia have other defects, including problems with the esophagus, urinary tract, and bones. In low anal atresia, the channel may open in front of the circular mass of muscles that con- strict to close the anal opening (anal sphincter) or, in boys, below the scrotum. Occasionally, the intestine ends just under the skin. It is estimated that overall abnormali- ties of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every 5,000 births and are slightly more common among boys. A mother who has one child with these kind of condi- tions has a 1% chance of having another child who suf- fers from this ailment. | No

3644 | NarrativeText | Anal atresia is a defect in the development of the fetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play a minor role. | No
3645 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3646 | NarrativeText | Usually a physician can make an obvious visual diagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally, however, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed and signs of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of the first or second day, the abdomen swells and there is vom- iting of fecal material. To determine the type of anal atre- sia and the exact position, x rays will be taken which include injecting opaque dye into the opening. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography scans (CT), as well as ultrasound, are the imaging tech- niques used to determine the type and size of the anal atresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT scans pass x rays through the body at different angles, and an MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves. | No

3654 | NarrativeText | Surgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. For high anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is made, a surgical incision is made in the large intestine to make a temporary opening (colostomy) in the abdomen where waste is excreted. Several months later, the intestine is moved into the ring of muscle (sphincter) that is part of the anus and a hole is made in the skin. The colostomy is closed several weeks later. In low anal atresia, immediate- ly after diagnosis, a hole is made in the skin to open the area where the anus should be. If the channel is in the wrong place, the intestine is moved into the correct posi- tion sometime during the child’s first year. After surgery, the pediatric surgeon uses an instrument to dilate or widen the rectum and teaches the parents how to do this daily at home to prevent scar tissue from contracting. | No
3655 | Title | Prognosis | No

3666 | NarrativeText | Anal cancer is an uncommon form of cancer affect- ing the anus. The anus is the inch-and-a-half-long end portion of the large intestine, which opens to allow solid wastes to exit the body. Other parts of the large intestine include the colon and the rectum. | No
3667 | Title | Description | No
3668 | NarrativeText | Different cancers can develop in different parts of the anus, part of which is inside the body and part of which is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of the anus are harmless in their early stages but may later develop into cancer. Some anal warts, for example, con- tain precancerous areas and can develop into cancer. Types of anal cancer include: ¢ Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half of anal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which arise from the cells lining the anal margin and the anal canal. The anal margin is the part of the anus that is half inside and half outside the body, and the anal canal is the part of the anus that is inside the body. The earliest form of squamous cell carcinoma is known as carcinoma in situ, or Bowen’s disease. | No
3669 | ListItem | Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately one-fourth to one-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic carcinomas. These tumors develop in the transitional zone, or cloa- ca, which is a ring of tissue between the anal canal and the rectum. | No

3671 | ListItem | ¢ Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers are either basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melanomas, two types of skin cancer. Malignant melanomas, which develop from skin cells that produce the brown pigment called melanin, are far more common on areas of the body exposed to the sun. | No
3672 | NarrativeText | Approximately 3,500 Americans will be diagnosed with anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500 individu- als will die of the disease during this same interval, according to the American Cancer Society. Anal cancers are fairly rare: they make up only 1% to 2% of cancers affecting the digestive system. The disease affects women somewhat more often than men, although the number of cases among men, particularly homosexual men, seems to be increasing. | No

3675 | NarrativeText | The exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown, although certain individuals appear to have a higher risk of developing the disease. Smokers are at higher risk, as are individuals with certain types of the human papillo- mavirus (HPV), and those with long-term problems in the anal area, such as abnormal openings known as fistu- las. Since it increases the risk of HPV infection, the prac- tice of anal sex appears to increase the risk of anal cancer—male homosexuals who practice anal sex are about 33 times more likely to have anal cancers than het- erosexual men. Those with weakened immune systems, such individuals with HIV, or transplant patients taking immunosuppressant drugs, are also at higher risk. Most individuals with anal cancer are over the age of 50. | No
3676 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of anal cancer resemble those found in other harmless conditions. They include pain, itching and bleeding, straining during a bowel movement, change in bowel habits, change in the diameter of the stool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph nodes in the anal or groin area. | No
3677 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3678 | NarrativeText | Anal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during routine physicals, or during minor procedures such as hemorrhoid removal. It may also be diagnosed during a digital rectal examination (DRE), when a physician inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the anus to feel for unusual growths. Individuals over the age of 50 who have no symptoms should have a digital rectal examination (DRE) every five to 10 years, according to American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines for early detection of colorectal cancer. | No
3679 | NarrativeText | Other diagnostic procedures for anal cancer include: Anoscopy. A procedure that involves use of a special device to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A procedure that involves use of a lighted scope to see the anal canal. Tran- srectal ultrasound. A procedure in which sound waves are used to create an image of the anus and nearby tissues. | No
3680 | NarrativeText | A biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths; that is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under a microscope for cancer cells. The physician may also per- form a procedure called a fine needle aspiration biopsy, in which a needle is used to withdraw fluid from lymph nodes located near the growth, to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread to these nodes. | No

3688 | NarrativeText | Anal cancer is treated using three methods, used either in concert or individually: surgery, radiation ther- apy, and chemotherapy. | No
3689 | NarrativeText | Two types of surgery may be performed. A local resection, performed if the cancer has not spread, removes the tumor and an area of tissue around the tumor. An abdominoperineal resection is a more complex proce- dure in which the anus and the lower rectum are removed, and an opening called a colostomy is created for body wastes to exit. This procedure is fairly uncommon today because radiation and chemotherapy are just as effective. | No
3690 | NarrativeText | Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to fight cancer cells. It is usually delivered via a machine outside the body, but may also be delivered via surgically implanted radioactive pellets. This latter method is called internal radiation, brachytherapy, or interstitial radiation. Side effects of radiation may include tiredness, skin dam- age resembling sunburn, and damage to anal tissues. | No
3691 | NarrativeText | Chemotherapy fights cancer using drugs, which may be delivered via pill or needle. Some chemotherapy types kill cancer cells directly, while others act indirectly by making cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation. The main drugs used to treat anal cancer are 5-fluorouracil (5- FU) and mitomycin or 5-FU and cisplatin. Side effects of chemotherapy, which damages normal cells in addition to cancer cells, may include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite, diarrhea, mouth sores, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a weakened immune system. | No

3728 | NarrativeText | Condyloma acuminatum is one of the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States. Young adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest risk. Risk factors include smoking, using oral contracep- tives, having multiple sexual partners, and an early coital age. In addition, individuals who have a history of immunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk. | No
3729 | NarrativeText | Roughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which are the least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become can- cerous.

3733 | NarrativeText | According to guidelines from the Centers for Dis- ease Control (CDC), the treatment of all genital warts, including anal warts, should be conducted according to the methods preferred by the patient, the medications or procedures most readily available, and the experience of the patient’s physician in removing anal warts. | No
3734 | NarrativeText | Treatment options include electrical cautery, surgi- cal removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the anal canal will almost always be treated with cauterization or surgical removal. Surgical removal, also known as exci- sion, has the highest success rates and lowest recurrence rates. Indeed, studies have shown that initial cure rates range from 63-91%. | No
3735 | NarrativeText | Unfortunately, most cases require numerous treat- ments because the virus that causes the warts can live in the surrounding tissue. The area may seem normal and wart-free for six months or longer before another wart develops. | No

3737 | NarrativeText | Electrocoagulation, a technique that uses electrical energy to destroy the warts, is usually the most painful of the procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminata of the anus, and is usually reserved for larger warts. It is done with local anesthesia, and may cause discharge or bleeding from the anus. | No
3738 | NarrativeText | Follow-up visits to the physician are necessary to make sure that the warts have not recurred. It is recom- mended that these patients see their physicians every three to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is how long the incubation period is for the HPV virus. | No
3739 | NarrativeText | Carbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca- tion are other options, but these are usually reserved for extensive warts or those that continue to recur despite numerous treatments. However, because HPV virus can be transmitted via the smoke caused by these procedures, they are usually reserved for the worst infections. | No
3740 | NarrativeText | For small warts that affect only the skin around the anus, several medications are available, which can be applied directly to the surface of the warts by a physician or by the patients themselves. | No
3741 | NarrativeText | Such medications include podophyllum resin (Podocon-25, Pod-Ben-25), a substance made from the cytotoxic extracts of several plants. This agent offers a cure rate of 20-50% when used alone, and is applied by the physician weekly and then washed off 6 hours later by the patient. | No
3742 | NarrativeText | Podofilox (Condylox) is another agent, and is avail- able for patients to use at home. It can be applied twice daily for up to 4 weeks. Podofilox offers a slightly higher cure rate than podophyllin, and can also be used to pre- vent warts. | No
3743 | NarrativeText | Trichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are avail- able in several concentrations up to 80% for the treat- ment of condyloma acuminata. These acids work to cau- terize the skin, and are quite caustic. Nevertheless, they cause less irritation and overall body effects than the other agents mentioned above. Recurrence, however, is higher with these acids. | No
3744 | NarrativeText | Bleomycin (Blenoxane) is another treatment option, but it has several drawbacks. First, it must be adminis- tered by a physician into each lesion via injection, but is can have a host of side effects, and patients must be fol- lowed carefully by their physician. | No
3745 | NarrativeText | Imiquimod 5% cream is also available for patients to apply themselves. It is to be applied three times weekly, for up to 16 weeks, and has been shown to clear warts within eight to 10 weeks. | No
3746 | NarrativeText | Finally, the interferon drugs, which are naturally occurring proteins that have antiviral and antitumor effects, are available. These include interferon alfa 2a and 2b (Roferon, Intron A), which are to be injected into each lesion twice a week for up to eight weeks. | No
3747 | Title | Prognosis | No
3748 | NarrativeText | Once a diagnosis of anal warts has been made, fur- ther outbreaks can be controlled or sometimes prevented with proper care. Unfortunately, many cases of anal warts either fail to respond to treatment or recur. Patients have to undergo roughly six to nine treatments over several months to assure that the warts are completely eradicated. | No
3749 | NarrativeText | Recurrence rates have been estimated to be over 50% after one year and may be due to the long incubation of HPV (up to 1.5 years), deep lesions, undetected lesions, virus present in surrounding skin that is not treated. | No
3750 | Title | Prevention | No
3751 | NarrativeText | Sexual abstinence and monogamous relationships can be the most effective form of prevention, and condoms may also decrease the chances of transmission of condylo- ma acuminata. Abstinence from sexual relations with peo- ple who have anal or genital warts can prevent infection. Unfortunately, since many people may not be aware that they have this condition, this is not always possible. | No
3752 | Title | KEY TERMS | No
3753 | NarrativeText | Electrocoagulation—a technique using electrical energy to destroy the warts. Usually done for warts within the anus with a local anesthesia, electroco- agulation is most painful form of therapy, and can cause both bleeding and discharge from the anus. | No
3754 | NarrativeText | Individuals infected with anal warts should have fol- low-up checkups every few weeks after their initial treat- ment, after which self-exams can be done. | No
3755 | NarrativeText | Sexual partners of people who have anal warts should also be examined, as a precautionary preventive measure. | No
3756 | NarrativeText | Finally, 5-flourouracil (Adrucil, Efudex, Fluoroplex) may be useful to prevent recurrence once the warts have been removed. Treatment must, however, be initiated within 1 month of wart removal. | No

3767 | NarrativeText | Analgesics are medicines that relieve pain. | No
3768 | Title | Purpose | No
3769 | NarrativeText | Analgesics are those drugs whose primary purpose is pain relief. The primary classes of analgesics are the narcotics, including additional agents that are chemically based on the morphine molecule but have minimal abuse potential; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including the salicylates; and acetaminophen. Other drugs, notably the tricyclic anti- depressants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin, have been used to relieve pain, particularly neurologic pain, but are not routinely classified as analgesics. Anal- gesics provide symptomatic relief, but have no effect on causation, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue of their dual activity, may be beneficial in both regards. | No
3770 | Title | Description | No
3771 | NarrativeText | Pain has been classified as “productive” pain and “non-productive” pain. While this distinction has no physiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to treat- ment. “Productive” pain has been described as a warning of injury, and so may be both an indication of need for treatment and a guide to diagnosis. “Non-productive” pain by definition serves no purpose either as a warning or diagnostic tool. | No
3772 | NarrativeText | Although pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the common factor is a sensory pathway from the affected organ to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of the nerves, either by blocking the signal from the peripheral nervous system, or by distorting the interpretation by the central nervous system. Selection of an appropriate anal- gesic is based on consideration of the risk-benefit factors of each class of drugs, based on type of pain, severity of pain, and risk of adverse effects. Traditionally, pain has been divided into two classes, acute and chronic, although severity and projected patient survival are other factors that must be considered in drug selection. | No
3773 | Title | Acute pain | No
3774 | NarrativeText | Acute pain is self limiting in duration, and includes post-operative pain, pain of injury, and childbirth. Because pain of these types is expected to be short term, the long-term side effects of analgesic therapy may rou- tinely be ignored. Thus, these patients may safely be treated with narcotic analgesics without concern for their addictive potential, or NSAIDs with only limited concern for their ulcerogenic risks. Drugs and doses should be adjusted based on observation of healing rate, switching patients from high to low doses, and from narcotic anal- gesics to non-narcotics when circumstances permit. | No
3775 | NarrativeText | An important consideration of pain management in severe pain is that patients should not be subject to the return of pain. Analgesics should be dosed adequately to assure that the pain is at least tolerable, and frequently enough to avoid the anxiety that accompanies the antici- pated return of pain. Analgesics should never be dosed on a “prn” (as needed) basis, but should be administered often | No
3776 | Title | 174 | No
3777 | NarrativeText | enough to assure constant blood levels of analgesic. This applies to both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics. | No
3778 | Title | Chronic pain | No
3779 | NarrativeText | Chronic pain, pain lasting over three months and severe enough to impair function, is more difficult to treat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesics are more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic anal- gesics this means the addiction potential, as well as res- piratory depression and constipation. For the NSAIDs, the risk of gastric ulcers may be dose limiting. While some classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/antag- onist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and pentazocine, and the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofe- coxib represent advances in reduction of adverse effects, they are still not fully suitable for long-term management of severe pain. Generally, chronic pain management requires a combination of drug therapy, life-style modifi- cation, and other treatment modalities. | No
3780 | Title | Narcotic analgesics | No
3781 | NarrativeText | The narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are all derived from opium. The class includes morphine, codeine, and a number of semi-synthetics including meperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and oth- ers. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all are effective in treatment of visceral pain when used in ade- quate doses. Adverse effects are dose related. Because these drugs are all addictive, they are controlled under federal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms are available, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous and intrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches. | No
3782 | NarrativeText | NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are effective analgesics even at doses too low to have any anti-inflammatory effects. There are a number of chemi- cal classes, but all have similar therapeutic effects and side effects. Most are appropriate only for oral adminis- tration; however ketorolac (Toradol) is appropriate for injection and may be used in moderate to severe pain for short periods. | No
3783 | NarrativeText | Acetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with no anti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild to moderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in nor- mal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high doses. Because acetaminophen is largely free of side effects at therapeutic doses, it has been considered the first choice for mild pain, including that of osteoarthritis. | No
3784 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
3785 | NarrativeText | Appropriate dosage varies by drug, and should con- sider the type of pain, as well as other risks associated | No

For example, narcotic analgesics should usually be avoided in patients with a history of substance abuse, but may be fully appropriate in patients with cancer pain. Similarly, because narcotics are more rapidly metabolized in patients who have used these drugs for a long period, higher than normal doses may be needed to provide adequate pain management. NSAIDs, although comparatively safe in adults, repre- sent an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients over the age of 60. | No
3793 | Title | Precautions | No
3794 | NarrativeText | Narcotic analgesics may be contraindicated in patients with respiratory depression. NSAIDS may be hazardous to patients with ulcers or an ulcer history. They should be used with care in patients with renal insufficiency or coagulation disorders. NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients allergic to aspirin. | No
3795 | Title | Side effects | No
3796 | NarrativeText | Review adverse effects of each drug individually. Drugs within a class may vary in their frequency and severity of adverse effects. | No
3797 | NarrativeText | The primary adverse effects of the narcotic anal- gesics are addiction, constipation, and respiratory depression. Because narcotic analgesics stimulate the production of enzymes that cause the metabolism of these drugs, patients on narcotics for a prolonged period may require increasing doses. This is not the same thing as addiction, and is not a reason for withholding medica- tion from patients in severe pain. | No
3798 | NarrativeText | NSAIDs are ulcerogenic and may cause kidney problems. Gastrointestinal discomfort is common, although in some cases, these drugs may cause ulcers without the prior warning of gastrointestinal distress. Platelet aggregation problems may occur, although not to the same extent as if seen with aspirin. | No

No evidence exists that these drugs cause birth defects in people, but some do cause birth defects and other problems when given to pregnant animals in experiments. Babies can become dependent on opioid analgesics if their mothers use too much during pregnancy. This can cause the baby to go through with- drawal symptoms after birth. If taken just before deliv- ery, some opioid analgesics may cause serious breathing problems in the newborn. | No

Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines, or do anything else that might be dan- gerous until they know how the drug affects them. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects, especially when first beginning to take the medicine. If these symptoms do not go away after the first few doses, check with the physi- cian or dentist who prescribed the medicine. | No
3839 | NarrativeText | Dry mouth is another common side effect. Dry mouth can be relieved by sucking on sugarless hard candy or ice chips or by chewing sugarless gum. Saliva substitutes, which come in liquid or tablet forms, also may help. Patients who must use opioid analgesics over long periods and who have dry mouth should see their dentists, as the problem can lead to tooth decay and other dental problems. | No

3884 | Title | Description | No
3885 | NarrativeText | Anaphylaxis is a type of allergic reaction, in which the immune system responds to otherwise harmless sub- stances from the environment. Unlike other allergic reactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill. Reaction may begin within minutes or even seconds of exposure, and rapidly progress to cause airway constriction, skin and intestinal irritation, and altered heart rhythms. In severe cases, it can result in complete airway obstruction, shock, and death. | No
3886 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
3887 | Title | Causes | No
3888 | NarrativeText | Like the majority of other allergic reactions, anaphy- laxis is caused by the release of histamine and other chemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type of white blood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tis- sues that regulate exchange with the environment: the airways, digestive system, and skin. | No
3889 | NarrativeText | On their surfaces, mast cells display antibodies called IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodies are designed to detect environmental substances to which the immune system is sensitive. Substances from a genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria or viruses, are called antigens. A substance that most peo- ple tolerate well, but to which others have an allergic response, is called an allergen. When IgE antibodies bind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to release histamine and other chemicals, which spill out onto neighboring cells. | No
3890 | NarrativeText | The interaction of these chemicals with receptors on the surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to leak fluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accumula- tion, redness, and swelling. On the smooth muscle cells of the airways and digestive system, they cause constric- tion. On nerve endings, they increase sensitivity and cause itching. | No
3891 | NarrativeText | In anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both to extreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usually systemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to cause anaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the circu- latory system by injection. However, exposure by inges- tion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause anaphy- laxis. In some cases, anaphylaxis may develop over time from less severe allergies. | No
3892 | NarrativeText | Anaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods, drugs, and insect venom. Specific causes include: ¢ fish, shellfish, and mollusks * nuts and seeds | No

3907 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3908 | NarrativeText | Anaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid devel- opment of symptoms in response to a suspect allergen. Identification of the culprit may be done with RAST test- ing, a blood test that identifies IgE reactions to specific allergens. Skin testing may be done for less severe ana- phylactic reactions. | No
3909 | Title | Treatment | No
3910 | NarrativeText | Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injec- tion of adrenaline (epinephrine) which constricts blood vessels and counteracts the effects of histamine. Oxygen may be given, as well as intravenous replacement fluids. Antihistamines may be used for skin rash, and amino- phylline for bronchial constriction. If the upper airway is obstructed, placement of a breathing tube or tracheosto- my tube may be needed. | No

3917 | NarrativeText | The rapidity of symptom development is an indica- tion of the likely severity of reaction: the faster symp- toms develop, the more severe the ultimate reaction. Prompt emergency medical attention and close monitor- ing reduces the likelihood of death. Nonetheless, death is possible from severe anaphylaxis. For most people who receive rapid treatment, recovery is complete. | No
3918 | Title | Prevention | No
3919 | NarrativeText | Avoidance of the allergic trigger is the only reliable method of preventing anaphylaxis. For insect allergies, this requires recognizing likely nest sites. Preventing food allergies requires knowledge of the prepared foods or dishes in which the allergen is likely to occur, and careful questioning about ingredients when dining out. Use of a Medic-Alert tag detailing drug allergies is vital to prevent inadvertent administration during a medical emergency. | No
3920 | NarrativeText | People prone to anaphylaxis should carry an “Epi- pen” or “Ana-kit,” which contain an adrenaline dose ready for injection. | No

3932 | NarrativeText | Anemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin (the component of red blood cells that delivers oxygen to tis- sues throughout the body). | No
3933 | Title | Description | No
3934 | NarrativeText | The tissues of the human body need a regular supply of oxygen to stay healthy. Red blood cells, which contain hemoglobin that allows them to deliver oxygen throughout the body, live for only about 120 days. When they die, the iron they contain is returned to the bone marrow and used to create new red blood cells. Anemia develops when heavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when some- thing happens to slow down the production of red blood cells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed. | No
3935 | Title | Types of anemia | No
3936 | NarrativeText | Anemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough to lead to life-threatening complications. More than 400 different types of anemia have been identified. Many of them are rare. | No
3937 | NarrativeText | IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Iron deficiency ane- mia is the most common form of anemia in the world. In the United States, iron deficiency anemia affects about 240,000 toddlers between one and two years of age and 3.3 million women of childbearing age. This condition is less common in older children and in adults over 50 and rarely occurs in teenage boys and young men. | No
3938 | NarrativeText | The onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and, at first, there may not be any symptoms. The deficiency begins when the body loses more iron than it derives from food and other sources. Because depleted iron stores cannot meet the red blood cell’s needs, fewer red blood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the red blood cells look normal, but they are reduced in number. Then the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiency by producing more red blood cells, which are character- istically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage. | No
3939 | NarrativeText | FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid defi- ciency anemia is the most common type of megaloblas- tic anemia (in which red blood cells are bigger than nor- mal). It is caused by a deficiency of folic acid, a vitamin that the body needs to produce normal cells. | No
3940 | ListItem | * cheese * eggs | No
3941 | ListItem | * fish * green vegetables | No
3942 | ListItem | * meat «milk | No
3943 | ListItem | * mushrooms * yeast | No
3944 | NarrativeText | Smoking raises the risk of developing this condition by interfering with the absorption of Vitamin C, which the body needs to absorb folic acid. Folic acid anemia can be a complication of pregnancy, when a woman’s body needs eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise. | No
3945 | NarrativeText | VITAMIN B,, DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Less common in this country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B,, deficien- cy anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia that develops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of this nutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood cells, B,, is found in meat and vegetables. | No
3946 | NarrativeText | Large amounts of B,, are stored in the body, so this condition may not become apparent until as much as four years after B,, absorption stops or slows down. The resulting drop in red blood cell production can cause: + loss of muscle control + loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet | No
3947 | ListItem | * soreness or burning of the tongue * weight loss | No
3948 | ListItem | + yellow-blue color blindness The most common form of B,, deficiency is perni- cious anemia. Since most people who eat meat or eggs get enough B,, in their diets, a deficiency of this vitamin usually means that the body is not absorbing it properly. This can occur among people who have had intestinal surgery or among those who do not produce adequate amounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical secreted by the stomach lining that combines with B,, to help its absorp- tion in the small intestine. | No
3949 | NarrativeText | Pernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages of 50-60. Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet increas- es the risk of developing pernicious anemia. So do: + diabetes mellitus | No
3950 | Title | * gastritis, stomach cancer, or stomach surgery | No
3951 | ListItem | * thyroid disease ¢ family history of pernicious anemia | No
3952 | NarrativeText | VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A rare disorder that causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormally small red blood cells, Vitamin C deficiency anemia results from a severe, long-standing dietary deficiency. | No
3953 | NarrativeText | HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Some people are born with hemolytic anemia. Some acquire this condition, in which infection or antibodies destroy red blood cells more rapidly than bone marrow can replace them. | No
3954 | NarrativeText | Hemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, accelerat- ing the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Other complications of hemolytic anemia include: * pain * shock | No
3955 | ListItem | + gallstones and other serious health problems THALASSEMIAS. An inherited form of hemolytic anemia, thalassemia stems from the body’s inability to manufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it needs. There are two categories of thalassemia, depending on which of the amino acid chains is affected. (Hemoglobin is composed of four chains of amino acids.) In alpha-tha- lassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of the alpha chain of amino acids; in beta-thalassemia, there is an imbalance in the beta chain. Alpha-thalassemias most commonly affect blacks (25% have at least one gene); beta-thalassemias most commonly affect people of Mediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians. | No
3956 | NarrativeText | Characterized by production of red blood cells that are unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only affects people who inherit the gene for it from each parent (auto- somal recessive inheritance). | No
3957 | NarrativeText | AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm anti- body hemolytic anemia is the most common type of this disorder. This condition occurs when the body produces autoantibodies that coat red blood cells. The coated cells are destroyed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow. | No
3958 | NarrativeText | Warm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common in women than in men. About one-third of patients who have warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lym- phoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective tissue disease. | No
3959 | NarrativeText | In cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body attacks red blood cells at or below normal body temperature. The acute form of this condition frequently develops in peo- ple who have had pneumonia, mononeucleosis, or other acute infections. It tends to be mild and short-lived, and disappears without treatment. | No
3960 | NarrativeText | Chronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most common in women and most often affects those who are over 40 and who have arthritis. This condition usually lasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms. However, exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate | No

3962 | NarrativeText | red blood cell destruction, causing fatigue, joint aches, and discoloration of the arms and hands. | No
3963 | NarrativeText | SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. Sickle cell anemia is a chron- ic, incurable condition that causes the body to produce defective hemoglobin, which forces red blood cells to assume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike normal oval cells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough hemoglobin to nourish body tissues. The deformed shape makes it hard for sickle cells to pass through narrow blood ves- sels. When capillaries become obstructed, a life-threaten- ing condition called sickle cell crisis is likely to occur. | No
3964 | NarrativeText | Sickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost always affects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. A child who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parent will have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle cell gene from only one parent carries the sickle cell trait, but does not have the disease. | No
3965 | NarrativeText | APLASTIC ANEMIA. Sometimes curable by bone marrow transplant, but potentially fatal, aplastic anemia is characterized by decreased production of red and white blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells that allow the blood to clot). This disorder may be inherited or acquired as a result of: * recent severe illness long-term exposure to industrial chemicals | No
3966 | ListItem | + use of anticancer drugs and certain other medications ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer, chronic infection or inflammation, and kidney and liver disease often cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic liver fail- ure generally produces the most severe symptoms. | No
3967 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
3968 | NarrativeText | Anemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red blood cell production, or increased red blood cell destruction. Poor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and iron deficiency anemias in which fewer red blood cells are produced. Hereditary disorders and certain diseases can cause increased blood cell destruction. However, exces- sive bleeding is the most common cause of anemia, and the speed with which blood loss occurs has a significant effect on the severity of symptoms. Chronic blood loss is usually a consequence of: * cancer * gastrointestinal tumors | No
3969 | ListItem | * diverticulosis * polyposis | No
3970 | ListItem | ¢ heavy menstrual flow * hemorrhoids | No

3974 | ListItem | * injury * a ruptured blood vessel | No
3975 | ListItem | * surgery When a lot of blood is lost within a short time, blood pressure and the amount of oxygen in the body drop sud- denly. Heart failure and death can follow. | No
3976 | NarrativeText | Loss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume in the space of several hours can be fatal. More gradual blood loss is less serious, because the body has time to create new red blood cells to replace those that have been lost. | No
3977 | Title | Symptoms | No
3978 | NarrativeText | Weakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be signs of mild anemia. Skin that is pasty or sallow, or lack of color in the creases of the palm, gums, nail beds, or lining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia. Someone who is weak, tires easily, is often out of breath, and feels faint or dizzy may be severely anemic. | No
3979 | NarrativeText | Other symptoms of anemia are: * angina pectoris (chest pain, often accompanied by a choking sensation that provokes severe anxiety) | No
3980 | ListItem | * cravings for ice, paint, or dirt * headache | No

3988 | ListItem | * tingling in the hands and feet * confusion, depression, and memory loss | No
3989 | NarrativeText | Pernicious anemia can damage the spinal cord. A doctor should be notified whenever symptoms of this condition occur. | No
3990 | NarrativeText | A doctor should also be notified if a patient who has been taking iron supplements develops: ¢ diarrhea * cramps | No
3991 | ListItem | * vomiting | No
3992 | Title | Diagnosis | No
3993 | NarrativeText | Personal and family health history may suggest the presence of certain types of anemia. Laboratory tests that measure the percentage of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood are used to confirm diagnosis and determine which type of anemia is responsible for a patient’s symptoms. X rays and examinations of bone marrow may be used to identify the source of bleeding. | No
3994 | Title | Treatment | No
3995 | NarrativeText | Anemia due to nutritional deficiencies can usually be treated at home with iron supplements or self adminis- tered injections of vitamin B,,. People with folic acid anemia should take oral folic acid replacements. Vitamin C deficiency anemia can be cured by taking one vitamin C tablet a day. | No
3996 | NarrativeText | Surgery may be necessary to treat anemia caused by excessive loss of blood. Transfusions of red blood cells may be used to accelerate production of red blood cells. | No
3997 | NarrativeText | Medication or surgery may also be necessary to con- trol heavy menstrual flow, repair a bleeding ulcer, or remove polyps (growths or nodules) from the bowels. | No
3998 | NarrativeText | Patients with thalassemia usually do not require treatment. However people with a severe form may require periodic hospitalization for blood transfusions and/or bone marrow transplantation. | No
3999 | NarrativeText | SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. Treatment for sickle cell ane- mia involves regular eye examinations, immunizations for pneumonia and infectious diseases, and prompt treat- ment for sickle cell crises and infections of any kind. Psychotherapy or counseling may help patients deal with the emotional impact of this condition. | No
4000 | NarrativeText | VITAMIN B,, DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A life-long regi- men of B,, shots is necessary to control symptoms of per- nicious anemia. The patient may be advised to limit phys- ical activity until treatment restores strength and balance. | No

4002 | NarrativeText | APLASTIC ANEMIA. People who have aplastic ane- mia are especially susceptible to infection. Treatment for aplastic anemia may involve blood transfusions and bone marrow transplant to replace malfunctioning cells with healthy ones. | No
4003 | NarrativeText | ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. There is no specific treatment for anemia associated with chronic disease, but treating the underlying illness may alleviate this condi- tion. This type of anemia rarely becomes severe. If it does, transfusions or hormone treatments to stimulate red blood cell production may be prescribed. | No
4004 | NarrativeText | HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. There is no specific treatment for cold-antibody hemolytic anemia. About one-third of patients with warm-antibody hemolytic anemia respond well to large doses of intravenous and oral corticos- teroids, which are gradually discontinued as the patient’s condition improves. Patients with this condition who don’t respond to medical therapy must have the spleen surgically removed. This operation controls anemia in about half of the patients on whom it’s performed. Immune-system suppressants are prescribed for patients whose surgery is not successful. | No
4005 | Title | Self-care | No
4006 | NarrativeText | Anyone who has anemia caused by poor nutrition should modify his or her diet to include more vitamins, minerals, and iron. Vitamin C can stimulate iron absorp- tion. The following foods are also good sources of iron: « almonds + broccoli | No
4007 | ListItem | + dried beans ¢ dried fruits | No
4008 | ListItem | * enriched breads and cereals * lean red meat | No
4009 | ListItem | * liver * potatoes | No
4010 | ListItem | * poultry * rice | No
4011 | ListItem | ¢ shellfish * tomatoes | No
4012 | NarrativeText | Because light and heat destroy folic acid, fruits and vegetables should be eaten raw or cooked as little as pos- sible. | No
4013 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
4014 | NarrativeText | As is the case in standard medical treatment, the cause of the specific anemia will determine the alterna- tive treatment recommended. If the cause is a deficiency, for example iron deficiency, folic acid deficiency, B,, deficiency, or vitamin C deficiency, supplementation is the treatment. For extensive blood loss, the cause should be identified and corrected. Other types of anemias should be addressed on a deep healing level with crisis intervention when necessary. | No
4015 | NarrativeText | Many alternative therapies for iron-deficiency ane- mia focus on adding iron-rich foods to the diet or on techniques to improve circulation and digestion. Iron supplementation, especially with iron citrate (less likely to cause constipation), is used by alternative practition- ers. This can be given in combination with herbs that are rich in iron. Some examples of iron-rich herbs are dande- lion (Taraxacum officinale), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), and nettle (Urtica dioica). The homeopathic remedy ferrum phosphoricum can also be helpful. | No
4016 | NarrativeText | An iron-rich herbal tonic can also me made using the following recipe: * soak 1/2 oz of yellow dock root and 1/2 oz dandelion root in 1 qt of boiled water for four to 8 hours * strain and simmer until the amount of liquid is reduced to 1 cup | No
4017 | ListItem | * remove from heat and add 1/2 cup black strap molasses, mixing well * store in refrigerator; take 1 tsp-2 Tbsp daily | No
4018 | NarrativeText | Other herbal remedies used to treat iron-deficiency anemia aim to improve the digestion. Gentian (Gentiana lutea) is widely used in Europe to treat anemia and other nutritionally based disorders. The bitter qualities of gen- tian help stimulate the digestive system, making iron and other nutrients more available for absorption. This bitter herb can be brewed into tea or purchased as an alcoholic extract (tincture). | No
4019 | NarrativeText | Other herbs recommended to promote digestion include: * anise (Pimpinella anisum) | No

4027 | Title | Folic-acid and iron-deficiency anemias | No
4028 | NarrativeText | It usually takes three to six weeks to correct folic acid or iron deficiency anemia. Patients should continue taking supplements for another six months to replenish iron reserves and should have periodic blood tests to make sure the bleeding has stopped and the anemia has not recurred. | No
4029 | Title | Pernicious anemia | No
4030 | NarrativeText | Although pernicious anemia is considered incurable, regular B,, shots will alleviate symptoms and reverse complications. Some symptoms will disappear almost as soon as treatment begins. | No

4068 | NarrativeText | General anesthesia is the induction of a state of uncon- sciousness with the absence of pain sensation over the entire body, through the administration of anesthetic drugs. It is used during certain medical and surgical procedures. | No
4069 | Title | Purpose | No
4070 | NarrativeText | General anesthesia has many purposes including: * pain relief (analgesia) | No
4071 | ListItem | * blocking memory of the procedure (amnesia) | No
4072 | ListItem | * producing unconsciousness + inhibiting normal body reflexes to make surgery safe and easier to perform | No
4073 | ListItem | ¢ relaxing the muscles of the body | No
4074 | Title | Description | No
4075 | ListItem | * Stage One: Analgesia. The patient experiences analge- sia or a loss of pain sensation but remains conscious and can carry on a conversation. | No
4076 | ListItem | * Stage Two: Excitement. The patient may experience delirium or become violent. Blood pressure rises and becomes irregular, and breathing rate increases. This stage is typically bypassed by administering a barbitu- rate, such as sodium pentothal, before the anesthesia. | No
4077 | ListItem | ¢ Stage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage, the skeletal muscles relax, and the patient’s breathing becomes regular. Eye movements slow, then stop, and surgery can begin. | No
4078 | ListItem | « Stage Four: Medullary Paralysis. This stage occurs if the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of the brain that control breathing and other vital functions cease to function. Death can result if the patient cannot be revived quickly. This stage should never be reached. Careful control of the amounts of anesthetics adminis- tered prevent this occurrence. | No
4079 | NarrativeText | Agents used for general anesthesia may be either gases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaled with oxygen, or drugs delivered intravenously. A combi- nation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugs are usually delivered during general anesthesia; this practice is called balanced anesthesia and is used because it takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes- thetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, the extent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a general anesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con- centration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathed by the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by an intravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot be changed as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes- thetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia and then followed by inhaled anesthetic agents. | No
4080 | NarrativeText | General anesthesia works by altering the flow of sodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through the cell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this is not understood since the drug apparently does not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and does not seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmit nerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It is known, however, that when the sodium molecules do not get into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generated and the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem- ories, does not register pain impulses from other areas of the body, and does not control involuntary reflexes. Although anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not the same. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up while others slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con- sciousness is more widespread. | No
4081 | Title | 186 | No
4082 | NarrativeText | When general anesthesia was first introduced in medical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled with the physician manually covering the patient’s mouth. Since then, general anesthesia has become much more sophisticated. During most surgical procedures, anesthet- ic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer- ized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoring as well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo- gists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery of anesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes- thetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo- rane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide. | No
4083 | ListItem | ¢ Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and can easily be overadministered. This drug causes uncon- sciousness but little pain relief so it is often used with other agents to control pain. Very rarely, it can be toxic to the liver in adults, causing death. It also has the potential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmias. Halothane has a pleasant odor, and was frequently the anesthetic of choice for use with children, but since the introduction of sevofluorane in the 1990s, halothane use has declined. | No
4084 | ListItem | Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a more rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakening than halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer of paralyzing agents. Enflurane has been found to increase intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures; therefore, its use is contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders. | No
4085 | ListItem | Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can cause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is often used in combination with intravenous anesthetics for anesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia is faster than it is with halothane and enfluorane. | No
4086 | ListItem | Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate and should not be used in patients with aortic valve steno- sis; however, it does not usually cause heart arrhyth- mias. Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation during induction and is therefore used with intravenous anesthetics for induction. Desflurane is rapidly elimi- nated and awakening is therefore faster than with other inhaled agents. | No
4087 | ListItem | Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased heart rate and should not be used in patients with narrowed aortic valve (stenosis); however, it does not usually cause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluo- rane does not cause any coughing or other related side effects, and can therefore be used without intravenous agents for rapid induction. For this reason, sevofluorane is replacing halothane for induction in pediatric patients. Like desfluorane, this agent is rapidly elimi- nated and allows rapid awakening. | No
4088 | ListItem | + Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a weak anesthetic and is used with other agents, such as thiopental, to produce surgical anesthesia. It has the fastest induction and recovery and is the safest because it does not slow breathing or blood flow to the brain. However, it diffus- es rapidly into air-containing cavities and can result in a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) or lower the oxygen contents of tissues (hypoxia). | No
4089 | NarrativeText | Commonly administered intravenous anesthetic agents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and propofol. | No
4090 | ListItem | * Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces a dissociative anesthesia (catatonia, amnesia, analgesia) in which the patient may appear awake and reactive, but cannot respond to sensory stimuli. These properties make it especially useful for use in developing coun- tries and during warfare medical treatment. Ketamine is frequently used in pediatric patients because anesthesia and analgesia can be achieved with an intramuscular injection. It is also used in high-risk geriatric patients and in shock cases, because it also provides cardiac stimulation. | No
4091 | ListItem | Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces a rapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because thiopen- tal is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic accumula- tion can occur; therefore, it should not be continuously infused. Side effects include nausea and vomiting upon awakening. | No
4092 | ListItem | Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, and are frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as a sedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusion for primary anesthesia. Because opioids rarely affect the cardiovascular system, they are particularly useful for cardiac surgery and other high-risk cases. Opioids act directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqently used in epidurals for spinal anesthesia. Side effects may include nausea and vomiting, itching, and respiratory depression. | No
4093 | ListItem | Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic agent and the most recently developed intravenous anesthetic. Its rapid induction and short duration of action are iden- tical to thiopental, but recovery occurs more quickly and with much less nausea and vomiting. Also, propo- fol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine, so it can be used for long durations of anes- thesia, unlike thiopental. Hence, propofol is rapidly replacing thiopental as an intravenous induction agent. It is used for general surgery, cardiac surgery, neuro- surgery, and pediatric surgery. | No
4094 | NarrativeText | General anesthetics are given only by anesthesiolo- gists, the medical professionals trained to use them. These specialists consider many factors, including a patient’s age, weight, medication allergies, medical history, and general health, when deciding which anesthetic or combi- nation of anesthetics to use. General anesthetics are usual- ly inhaled through a mask or a breathing tube or injected into a vein, but are also sometimes given rectally. | No
4095 | NarrativeText | General anesthesia is much safer today than it was in the past. This progress is due to faster-acting anesthetics, improved safety standards in the equipment used to deliver the drugs, and better devices to monitor breath- ing, heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity during surgery. Unpleasant side effects are also less common. | No
4096 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
4097 | NarrativeText | The dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, the patient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgery or medical procedure being done, and other medication the patient takes before, during, or after surgery. | No
4098 | Title | Precautions | No
4099 | NarrativeText | Although the risks of serious complications from general anesthesia are very low, they can include heart attack, stroke, brain damage, and death. Anyone sched- uled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughly discuss the benefits and risks with a physician. The risks of complications depend, in part, on a patient’s age, sex, weight, allergies, general health, and history of smoking, drinking alcohol, or drug use. Some of these risks can be minimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesi- ologist are fully informed of the detailed health condition of the patient, including any drugs that he or she may be using. Older people are especially sensitive to the effects of certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experi- ence side effects from these drugs. | No
4100 | NarrativeText | Patients who have had general anesthesia should not drink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slow down the central nervous system (such as antihista- mines, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain relievers, muscle relaxants, and anti-seizure medication) for at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care. | No
4101 | Title | Special conditions | No
4102 | NarrativeText | People with certain medical conditions are at greater risk of developing problems with anesthetics. Before undergoing general anesthesia, anyone with the follow- ing conditions should absolutely inform their doctor. | No
4103 | NarrativeText | ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had allergic or other unusual reactions to barbiturates or general anesthetics in the past should notify the doctor before having general anesthesia.

These symptoms can occur following the admin- istration of general anesthesia using inhaled agents, espe- cially halothane. In addition, the doctor should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
4105 | NarrativeText | PREGNANCY. The effects of anesthetics on pregnant women and fetuses vary, depending on the type of drug. In general, giving large amounts of general anesthetics to the mother during labor and delivery may make the baby slug- gish after delivery. Pregnant women should discuss the use of anesthetics during labor and delivery with their doctors. Pregnant women who may be given general anesthesia for other medical procedures should ensure that the treating physician is informed about the pregnancy. | No
4106 | Title | Side effects | No
4107 | NarrativeText | Because general anesthetics affect the central ner- vous system, patients may feel drowsy, weak, or tired for as long as a few days after having general anesthesia. Fuzzy thinking, blurred vision, and coordination prob- lems are also possible. For these reasons, anyone who has had general anesthesia should not drive, operate machinery, or perform other activities that could endan- ger themselves or others for at least 24 hours, or longer if necessary. | No
4108 | NarrativeText | Most side effects usually disappear as the anesthetic wears off. A nurse or doctor should be notified if these or other side effects persist or cause problems, such as: « Headache * vision problems, including blurred or double vision | No

This includes prescription drugs, nonprescription medicines, and street drugs. Seri- ous and possibly life-threatening reactions may occur when general anesthetics are given to people who use street drugs, such as cocaine, marijuana, phencyclidine (PCP or angel dust), amphetamines (uppers), barbiturates (downers), heroin, or other narcotics.

4158 | NarrativeText | Local or regional anesthesia involves the injection or application of an anesthetic drug to a specific area of the body, as opposed to the entire body and brain as occurs during general anesthesia. | No
4159 | Title | Purpose | No
4160 | NarrativeText | Local anesthetics are used to prevent patients from feeling pain during medical, surgical, or dental proce- dures. Over-the-counter local anesthetics are also avail- able to provide temporary relief from pain, irritation, and itching caused by various conditions, such as cold sores, canker sores, sore throats, sunburn, insect bites, poison ivy, and minor cuts and scratches. | No
4161 | NarrativeText | Types of surgery or medical procedures that regular- ly make use of local or regional anesthesia include the following: + biopsies in which skin or tissue samples are taken for diagnostic procedures + childbirth | No
4162 | ListItem | * surgeries on the arms, hands, legs, or feet * eye surgery | No
4163 | ListItem | * surgeries involving the urinary tract or sexual organs Surgeries involving the chest and abdomen are usu- ally performed under general anesthesia. | No
4164 | NarrativeText | Local and regional anesthesia have advantages over general anesthesia in that patients can avoid some unpleasant side effects, can receive longer lasting pain relief, have reduced blood loss, and maintain a sense of psychological comfort by not losing consciousness. | No
4165 | Title | Description | No
4166 | NarrativeText | Regional anesthesia typically affects a larger area than local anesthesia, for example, everything below the waist. As a result, regional anesthesia may be used for more involved or complicated surgical or medical procedures. Regional anesthetics are injected. Local anesthesia involves the injection into the skin or muscle or application to the skin of an anesthetic directly where pain will occur. Local anesthesia can be divided into four groups: injectable, topi- cal, dental (non-injectable), and ophthalmic. | No
4167 | NarrativeText | Local and regional anesthesia work by altering the flow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neurons through the cell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this is not understood, since the drug apparently does not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and does not seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmit nerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It is known, however, that when the sodium molecules do not get into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generat- ed and pain impulses are not transmitted to the brain. The duration of action of an anesthetic depends on the type and amount of anesthetic administered. | No
4168 | Title | Regional anesthesia | No
4169 | ListItem | ¢ Spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia involves the injec- tion of a small amount of local anesthetic directly into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord (the subarachnoid space). Blood pressure drops are com- mon but are easily treated. | No
4170 | ListItem | ¢ Epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia involves the injection of a large volume of local anesthetic directly into the space surrounding the spinal fluid sac (the epidural space), not into the spinal fluid. Pain relief occurs more slowly but is less likely to produce blood pressure drops. Also, the block can be maintained for long periods, even days. | No
4171 | ListItem | * Nerve blocks. Nerve blocks involve the injection of an anesthetic into the area around a nerve that supplies a particular region of the body, preventing the nerve from carrying nerve impulses to the brain. | No
4172 | NarrativeText | Anesthetics may be administered with another drug, such as epinephrine (adrenaline), which decreases bleed- ing, and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity of a drug so that it will work faster. In addition, drugs may be administered to help a patient remain calm and more comfortable or to make them sleepy. | No
4173 | Title | Local anesthesia | No
4174 | NarrativeText | INJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS. These medicines are given by injection to numb and provide pain relief to some part of the body during surgery, dental procedures, or other medical procedures. They are given only by a trained health care professional and only in a doctor’s office or a hospital. Some commonly used injectable local anesthetics are procaine (Novocain), lidocaine (Dalcaine, Dilocaine, L-Caine, Nervocaine, Xylocaine, and other brands), and tetracaine (Pontocaine). | No
4175 | NarrativeText | TOPICAL ANESTHETICS. Topical anesthetics, such as benzocaine, lidocaine, dibucaine, pramoxine, butamben, and tetracaine, relieve pain and itching by deadening the nerve endings in the skin. They are ingredients in a vari- ety of nonprescription products that are applied to the skin to relieve the discomfort of sunburn, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, and minor cuts, scratches, and burns. These products are sold as creams, ointments, sprays, lotions, and gels. | No
4176 | NarrativeText | DENTAL ANESTHETICS (NON-INJECTABLE). Some local anesthetics are intended for pain relief in the mouth or throat. They may be used to relieve throat pain, teething pain, painful canker sores, toothaches, or dis- comfort from dentures, braces, or bridgework. Some dental anesthetics are available only with a doctor’s pre- scription. Others may be purchased without a prescrip- tion, including products such as Num-Zit, Orajel, Chlo- raseptic lozenges, and Xylocaine. | No
4177 | NarrativeText | OPHTHAIMIC ANESTHETICS. Other local anesthetics are designed for use in the eye. The ophthalmic anesthetics proparacaine and tetracaine are used to numb the eye before certain eye examinations. Eye doctors may also use these medicines before measuring eye pressure or remov- ing stitches or foreign objects from the eye. These drugs are to be given only by a trained health care professional. | No
4178 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
4179 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of local anesthetic and the purpose for which it is being used. When using a nonprescription local anesthetic, fol- low the directions on the package. Questions concerning how to use a product should be referred to a medical doc- tor, dentist, or pharmacist. | No
4180 | Title | Precautions | No
4181 | NarrativeText | People who strongly feel that they cannot psycho- logically cope with being awake and alert during certain procedures may not be good candidates for local or regional anesthesia. Other medications may be given in conjunction with the anesthetic, however, to relieve anxi- ety and help the patient relax. | No
4182 | NarrativeText | Local anesthetics should be used only for the condi- tions for which they are intended. For example, a topical anesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain should not be used on cold sores. Anyone who has had an unusual reac- tion to any local anesthetic in the past should check with a doctor before using any type of local anesthetic again. The doctor should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
4183 | NarrativeText | Older people may be more sensitive to the effects of local anesthetics, especially lidocaine. This increased sen- sitivity may increase the risk of side effects. Older people who use nonprescription local anesthetics should be espe- cially careful not to use more than the recommended amount. Children also may be especially sensitive to the effects of some local anesthetics, which may increase the chance of side effects. Anyone using these medicines on a child should be careful not to use more than the amount that is recommended for children. Certain types of local anesthetics should not be used at all young children. Fol- low package directions carefully and check with a doctor of pharmacist if there are any questions. | No
4184 | Title | Regional anesthetics | No
4185 | NarrativeText | Serious, possibly life-threatening, side effects may occur when anesthetics are given to people who use street drugs. Anyone who uses cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, barbiturates, phencyclidine (PCP, or angel dust), heroin, or other street drugs should make sure their doctor or dentist knows what they have used. | No
4186 | NarrativeText | Patients who have had a particular kind of reaction called malignant hyperthermia (or who have one or more family members who have had this problem) during or just after receiving a general anesthetic should inform their doctors before receiving any kind of anesthetic. Signs of malignant hyperthermia include fast and irregu- lar heartbeat, very high fever, breathing problems, and muscle spasms or tightness. | No
4187 | NarrativeText | Although problems are rare, some unwanted side effects may occur when regional anesthetics are used during labor and delivery. These anesthetics can prolong labor and increase the risk of Cesarean section. Preg- nant women should discuss with their doctors the risks and benefits of being given these drugs. | No
4188 | NarrativeText | Patients should not drive or operate other machinery immediately following a procedure involving regional anesthesia, due to numbness and weakness, or if local anesthesia also included drugs to make the patient sleep or strong pain medications. Injection sites should be kept clean, dry, and uncovered to prevent infection. | No
4189 | Title | njectable local anesthetics | No
4190 | NarrativeText | Until the anesthetic wears off, patients should be careful not to injure the numbed area. If the anesthetic was used in the mouth, do not eat or chew gum until feel- ing returns. | No
4191 | Title | Topical anesthetics | No
4192 | NarrativeText | Unless advised by a doctor, topical anesthetics should not be used on or near any part of the body with large sores, broken or scraped skin, severe injury, or infection. They should also not be used on large areas of skin. Some topical anesthetics contain alcohol and should not be used near an open flame, or while smoking. | No
4193 | NarrativeText | Anyone using a topical anesthetic should be careful not to get this medication in the eyes, nose, or mouth. When using a spray form of this medication, do not spray it directly on the face, but apply it to the face with a cot- ton swab or sterile gauze pad. After using a topical anes- thetic on a child, make sure the child does not get the medicine in his or her mouth. | No
4194 | NarrativeText | Topical anesthetics are intended for the temporary relief of pain and itching. They should not be used for more than a few days at a time. Check with a doctor if: + the discomfort continues for more than seven days + the problem gets worse | No
4195 | ListItem | + the treated area becomes infected * new signs of irritation, such as skin rash, burning, sting- ing, or swelling appear | No
4196 | Title | Dental anesthetics (non-injectable) | No
4197 | NarrativeText | Dental anesthetics should not be used if certain kinds of infections are present. Check package directions or check with a dentist or medical doctor if uncertain. Dental anesthetics should be used only for temporary pain relief. If problems such as toothache, mouth sores, or pain from dentures or braces continue, check with a dentist. Check with a doctor if sore throat pain is severe, lasts more than two days, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, headache, skin rash, swelling, nausea, or vomiting. | No
4198 | NarrativeText | Patients should not eat or chew gum while the mouth is numb from a dental anesthetic. There is a risk of acci- dently biting the tongue or the inside of the mouth. Also nothing should be eaten or drunk for one hour after applying a dental anesthetic to the back of the mouth or throat, since the medicine may interfere with swallowing and may cause choking. If normal feeling does not return to the mouth within a few hours after receiving a dental anesthetic or if it is difficult to open the mouth, check with a dentist. | No
4199 | Title | Ophthalmic anesthetics | No
4200 | NarrativeText | When anesthetics are used in the eye, it is important not to rub or wipe the eye until the effect of the anesthet- ic has worn off and feeling has returned. Rubbing the eye while it is numb could cause injury. | No
4201 | Title | Side effects | No
4202 | NarrativeText | Side effects of regional or local anesthetics vary depending on the type of anesthetic used and the way it is administered. Anyone who has unusual symptoms fol- lowing the use of an anesthetic should get in touch with his or her doctor immediately. | No
4203 | NarrativeText | Paralysis after regional anesthesia, for example an epidural or spinal block, is extremely rare, but can occur. Paralysis reportedly occurs even less frequently than deaths due to general anesthesia. | No
4204 | NarrativeText | There is a small risk of developing a severe headache called a spinal headache following a spinal or epidural block. This headache is severe when the patient is upright and hardly felt when the patient lies down. Though rare, it can occur and can be treated by perform- ing a blood patch, in which a small amount of the patient’s own blood is injected into the area in the back where the anesthetic was injected. The blood clots and closes up any area that may have been leaking spinal fluid. Relief is almost immediate. Finally, blood clots or abscess can form in the back, but these are also readily treatable and so pose little risk. | No

4235 | NarrativeText | An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the aorta that is usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis. People who are 50-80 years old are most likely to devel- op an aortic aneurysm, with men four times more likely to develop one than women. | No
4236 | NarrativeText | An aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly. It rarely produces symptoms and is usually only diagnosed by accident during a routine physical exam or on an x ray or ultrasound done for another reason. As the aneurysm grows larger, the risk of bursting with no warning, which causes catastrophic bleeding, rises. A ruptured aortic aneurysm can cause sudden loss of a fatal amount of blood within minutes or it can leak in a series of small bleeds that lead within hours or days to massive bleeding. A leak- ing aortic aneurysm that is not treated is always fatal. | No
4237 | NarrativeText | Aneurysmectomy is performed to repair the two most common types of aortic aneurysms: abdominal aor- tic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below the kid- neys, and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur in the chest. It is major surgery performed in a hospital under general anesthesia and involves removing debris and then implanting a flexible tube (graft) to replace the enlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of the ascending aorta (the first part of the aorta that travels upward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lung machine that temporarily stops the heart while the aneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a one- week hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks. | No
4238 | NarrativeText | During surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either the abdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to expose the aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and below the aneurysm to stop the flow of blood. Then, an incision is made in the aneurysm. An artificial Dacron tube is sewn in place above and below the opened aneurysm, but the aneurysm is not removed. Plaque or clotted blood are cleaned from the diseased tissue. The clamps are removed and blood flow is re-established through the graft. The wall of the aneurysm is wrapped around the graft to pro- tect it and the skin of the abdomen or chest is sewn up. | No
4239 | NarrativeText | Aneurysmectomy can be performed as elective or emergency surgery. Elective aneurysmectomy takes about an hour and is far safer than emergency aneurysmectomy, with a mortality rate of 3-5% for elective abdominal aneurysmectomy and 5-10% for elective thoracic aneurysmectomy. When an aneurysm ruptures, 62% of patients die before they reach the hospital. Of those who make it into emergency aneurysmectromy, 50% die. After a successful aneurysmectomy, the patient has nearly the same life expectancy as other people of the same age. | No
4240 | Title | Preparation | No
4241 | NarrativeText | Before elective aneurysmectomy, blood studies, a chest x ray, cardiac catherization, electrocardiogram (ECG), and ultrasound are performed. | No
4242 | Title | Aftercare | No
4243 | NarrativeText | After aneurysmectomy, the patient is monitored in an Intensive Care Unit for the first 24-48 hours. Follow- up tests include ECG, chest x ray, and ultrasound. | No

4245 | NarrativeText | Elective aneurysmectomy has a 5-10% rate of compli- cations, such as bleeding, kidney failure, respiratory com- plications, heart attack, stroke, infection, limb loss, bowel ischemia, and impotence. These complications are many times more common in emergency aneurysmectomy. | No

4270 | NarrativeText | Angina is pain, “discomfort,” or pressure localized in the chest that is caused by an insufficient supply of blood (ischemia) to the heart muscle. It is also some- times characterized by a feeling of choking, suffocation, or crushing heaviness. This condition is also called angi- na pectoris. | No
4271 | Title | Description | No
4272 | NarrativeText | Often described as a muscle spasm and choking sen- sation, the term “angina” is used primarily to describe chest (thoracic) pain originating from insufficient oxygen to the heart muscle. An episode of angina is not an actual heart attack, but rather pain that results from the heart muscle temporarily receiving too little blood. This tem- porary condition may be the result of demanding activi- ties such as exercise and does not necessarily indicate that the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damage. In fact, episodes of angina seldom cause permanent dam- age to heart muscle. | No
4273 | NarrativeText | Angina can be subdivided further into two cate- gories: angina of effort and variant angina. | No
4274 | Title | Angina of effort | No
4275 | NarrativeText | Angina of effort is a common disorder caused by the narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. In the case of angina of effort, the heart (coronary) arteries can provide the heart muscle (myocardium) adequate blood during rest but not during periods of exercise, stress, or excite- ment—any of which may precipitate pain. The pain is relieved by resting or by administering nitroglycerin, a medication that reduces ischemia of the heart. Patients with angina of effort have an increased risk of heart attack (myocardial infarction). | No
4276 | Title | Variant angina | No
4277 | NarrativeText | Variant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen- dently of atherosclerosis which may, however, be present as an incidental finding. Variant angina occurs at rest and is not related to excessive work by the heart muscle. Research indicates that variant angina is caused by coro- nary artery muscle spasm of insufficient duration or intensity to cause an actual heart attack. | No
4278 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
4279 | NarrativeText | Angina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi- ness, usually in the chest area under the breast bone (ster- num). It occasionally is experienced in the shoulder, arm, neck, or jaw regions. Because episodes of angina occur when the heart’s need for oxygen increases beyond the oxygen available from the blood nourishing the heart, the condition is often precipitated by physical exertion. In most cases, the symptoms are relieved within a few min- utes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medica- tions. Emotional stress, extreme temperatures, heavy meals, cigarette smoking, and alcohol can also cause or contribute to an episode of angina. | No
4280 | Title | Diagnosis | No
4281 | NarrativeText | Physicians can usually diagnose angina based on the patient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors. Howev- er, other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm or tule out angina, or to determine the severity of the under- lying heart disease. | No
4282 | Title | Electrocardiogram (ECG) | No
4283 | NarrativeText | An electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical impulses from the heart. The resulting graph of electrical activity can show if the heart muscle isn’t functioning properly as a result of a lack of oxygen. Electrocardio- grams are also useful in investigating other possible abnormal features of the heart. | No
4284 | Title | Stress test | No
4285 | NarrativeText | For many individuals with angina, the results of an electrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnor- malities. Because the symptoms of angina occur during stress, the functioning of the heart may need to be evalu- ated under the physical stress of exercise. The stress test records information from the electrocardiogram before, during, and after exercise in search of stress-related abnormalities. Blood pressure is also measured during the stress test and symptoms are noted. A more involved and complex stress test (for example, thallium scanning) may be used in some cases to picture the blood flow in the heart muscle during the most intense time of exercise and after rest. | No
4286 | Title | Angiogram | No
4287 | NarrativeText | The angiogram, which is basically an x ray of the coronary artery, has been noted to be the most accurate diagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent of coronary disease. In this procedure, a long, thin, flexible tube (catheter) is maneuvered into an artery located in the forearm or groin. This catheter is passed further through the artery into one of the two major coronary arteries. A dye is injected at that time to help the x rays “see” the heart and arteries more clearly. Many brief x rays are made to create a “movie” of blood flowing through the coronary arteries, which will reveal any pos- sible narrowing that causes a decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina. | No
4288 | Title | Treatment | No
4289 | Title | Conservative treatment | No
4290 | NarrativeText | Artery disease causing angina is addressed initially by controlling existing factors placing the individual at risk. These risk factors include cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and obesity. Angina is often controlled by medication, most commonly with nitroglycerin. This drug relieves symptoms of angina by increasing the diameter of the blood vessels carrying blood to the heart muscle. Nitroglycerin is taken whenever discomfort occurs or is expected. It may be taken by mouth by placing the tablet under the tongue or transder- mally by placing a medicated patch directly on the skin. In addition, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers may be prescribed to also decrease the demand on the heart by decreasing the rate and workload of the heart. | No
4291 | Title | Surgical treatment | No
4292 | NarrativeText | When conservative treatments are not effective in the reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart attack remains high, physicians may recommend angioplasty or surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery is an opera- tion in which a blood vessel (often a long vein surgically removed from the leg) is grafted onto the blocked artery to bypass the blocked portion. This newly formed path- way allows blood to flow adequately to the heart muscle. | No
4293 | NarrativeText | Another procedure used to improve blood flow to the heart is balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, the physician inserts a catheter with a tiny balloon at the end into a forearm or groin artery. The catheter is then thread- ed up into the coronary arteries and the balloon is inflat- ed to open the vessel in narrowed sections. Other tech- niques using laser and mechanical devices are being developed and applied, also by means of catheters. | No
4294 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
4295 | NarrativeText | During an angina episode, relief has been noted by applying massage or kinesiological methods, but these techniques are not standard recommendations by physi- cians. For example, one technique places the palm and fingers of either hand on the forehead while simultane- ously firmly massaging the sternum (breast bone) up and down its entire length using the other hand. This is fol- lowed by additional massaging by the fingertip and thumb next to the sternum, on each side. | No
4296 | NarrativeText | Once the angina has subsided, the cause should be determined and treated. Atherosclerosis, a major associat- ed cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments, primari- ly including regular exercise, reduction of dietary sugar and saturated fats, and increase of dietary fiber. Both con- ventional and alternative medicine agree that increasing exercise and improving diet are important steps to reduce high cholesterol levels. Alternative medicine has pro- posed specific cholesterol-lowering treatments, with sev- eral gaining the attention and interest of the public. One of the most recent popular treatments is garlic (Allium sativum). Some studies have shown that adequate dosages of garlic can reduce total cholesterol by about 10%, LDL (bad) cholesterol by 15%, and raise HDL (good) choles- terol by 10%. Other studies have not shown significant benefit. Although its effect on cholesterol is not as great as that achieved by medications, garlic may possibly be of benefit in relatively mild cases of high cholesterol, with- out causing the side effects associated with cholesterol- reducing drugs. Other herbal remedies that may help lower cholesterol include alfalfa (Medicago sativa), fenu- greek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng), and tumeric (Curcuma longa). | No
4297 | NarrativeText | Antioxidants, including vitamin A (beta carotene), vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, can limit the oxida- tive damage to the walls of blood vessels that may be a precursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation. | No
4298 | Title | Prognosis | No
4299 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for a patient with angina depends on its origin, type, severity, and the general health of the individual. A person who has angina has the best progno- sis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention and learns the pattern of his or her angina, such as what causes the attacks, what they feel like, how long episodes usually last, and whether medication relieves the attacks. If pat- terns of the symptoms change significantly, or if symp- toms resemble those of a heart attack, medical help should be sought immediately. | No
4300 | Title | Prevention | No
4301 | NarrativeText | In most cases, the best prevention involves changing one’s habits to avoid bringing on attacks of angina. If blood pressure medication has been prescribed, compli- ance is a necessity and should be a priority as well. Many healthcare professionals—including physicians, dieti- KEY TERMS Ischemia—Decreased blood supply to an organ or body part, often resulting in pain. | No

These professionals also offer suggestions about current treatments and information to help stop smoking. In general, the majority of those with angina adjust their lives to minimize episodes of angina, by tak- ing necessary precautions and using medications if rec- ommended and necessary. Coronary artery disease is the underlying problem that should be addressed. | No

4317 | NarrativeText | Angiography is the x-ray study of the blood vessels. An angiogram uses a radiopaque substance, or dye, to make the blood vessels visible under x ray. Arteriography is a type of angiography that involves the study of the arteries. | No
4318 | Title | Purpose | No
4319 | NarrativeText | Angiography is used to detect abnormalities or blockages in the blood vessels (called occlusions) throughout the circulatory system and in some organs. The procedure is commonly used to identify atheroscle- rosis; to diagnose heart disease; to evaluate kidney func- tion and detect kidney cysts or tumors; to detect an aneurysm (an abnormal bulge of an artery that can rup- ture leading to hemorrhage), tumor, blood clot, or arteri- ovenous malformations (abnormals tangles of arteries and veins) in the brain; and to diagnose problems with the retina of the eye. It is also used to give surgeons an accurate “map” of the heart prior to open-heart surgery, or of the brain prior to neurosurgery. | No
4320 | Title | Precautions | No
4321 | NarrativeText | Patients with kidney disease or injury may suffer further kidney damage from the contrast mediums used for angiography. Patients who have blood clotting prob- lems, have a known allergy to contrast mediums, or are allergic to iodine, a component of some contrast medi- ums, may also not be suitable candidates for an angiogra- phy procedure. Because x rays carry risks of ionizing radiation exposure to the fetus, pregnant women are also advised to avoid this procedure. | No
4322 | Title | Description | No
4323 | NarrativeText | Angiography is usually performed at a hospital by a trained radiologist and assisting technician or nurse. It takes place in an x-ray or fluoroscopy suite, and for most types of angiograms, the patient’s vital signs will be monitored throughout the procedure. | No
4324 | NarrativeText | Angiography requires the injection of a contrast dye that makes the blood vessels visible to x ray. The dye is injected through a procedure known as arterial puncture. The puncture is usually made in the groin area, armpit, inside elbow, or neck. The site is cleaned with an antisep- tic agent and injected with a local anesthetic. First, a small incision is made in the skin to help the needle pass. A needle containing an inner wire called a stylet is insert- ed through the skin into the artery. When the radiologist has punctured the artery with the needle, the stylet is removed and replaced with another long wire called a guide wire. It is normal for blood to spout out of the nee- dle before the guide wire is inserted. | No
4325 | NarrativeText | The guide wire is fed through the outer needle into the artery and to the area that requires angiographic An angiogram of a coronary artery. (Phototake NYC. Repro- duced by permission.) | No

Once it is in position, the needle is removed and a catheter is slid over the length of the guide wire until it to reaches the area of study. The guide wire is removed and the catheter is left in place in prepa- ration for the injection of the contrast medium, or dye. | No
4327 | NarrativeText | Depending on the type of angiography procedure being performed, the contrast medium is either injected by hand with a syringe or is mechanically injected with an automatic injector connected to the catheter. An automatic injector is used frequently because it is able to propel a large volume of dye very quickly to the angiogram site. The patient is warned that the injection will start, and instructed to remain very still. The injec- tion causes some mild to moderate discomfort. Possible side effects or reactions include headache, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, nausea, warmth, burning sensation, and chest pain, but they usually last only momentarily. To view the area of study from different angles or per- spectives, the patient may be asked to change positions several times, and subsequent dye injections may be administered. During any injection, the patient or the camera may move. | No
4328 | NarrativeText | Throughout the dye injection procedure, x-ray pic- tures and/or fluoroscopic pictures (or moving x rays) will be taken. Because of the high pressure of arterial blood flow, the dye will dissipate through the patient’s system quickly, so pictures must be taken in rapid succession. | No
4329 | Title | 197 | No
4330 | NarrativeText | An automatic film changer is used because the manual changing of x-ray plates can eat up valuable time. | No
4331 | NarrativeText | Once the x rays are complete, the catheter is slowly and carefully removed from the patient. Pressure is applied to the site with a sandbag or other weight for 10- 20 minutes in order for clotting to take place and the arterial puncture to reseal itself. A pressure bandage is then applied. | No
4332 | NarrativeText | Most angiograms follow the general procedures out- lined above, but vary slightly depending on the area of the vascular system being studied. A variety of common angiography procedures are outlined below: Cerebral angiography Cerebral angiography is used to detect aneurysms, blood clots, and other vascular irregularities in the brain. The catheter is inserted into the femoral or carotid artery and the injected contrast medium travels through the blood vessels on the brain. Patients frequently experience headache, warmth, or a burning sensation in the head or neck during the injection portion of the procedure. A cerebral angiogram takes two to four hours to complete. | No
4333 | Title | Coronary angiography | No
4334 | NarrativeText | Coronary angiography is administered by a cardiol- ogist with training in radiology or, occasionally, by a radiologist. The arterial puncture is typically given in the femoral artery, and the cardiologist uses a guide wire and catheter to perform a contrast injection and x-ray series on the coronary arteries. The catheter may also be placed in the left ventricle to examine the mitral and aortic valves of the heart. If the cardiologist requires a view of the right ventricle of the heart or of the tricuspid or pul- monic valves, the catheter will be inserted through a large vein and guided into the right ventricle. The catheter also serves the purpose of monitoring blood pressures in these different locations inside the heart. The angiogram procedure takes several hours, depending on the complexity of the procedure. | No
4335 | Title | Pulmonary angiography | No
4336 | NarrativeText | Pulmonary, or lung, angiography is performed to evaluate blood circulation to the lungs. It is also consid- ered the most accurate diagnostic test for detecting a pul- monary embolism. The procedure differs from cerebral and coronary angiograms in that the guide wire and catheter are inserted into a vein instead of an artery, and are guided up through the chambers of the heart and into the pulmonary artery. Throughout the procedure, the patient’s vital signs are monitored to ensure that the catheter doesn’t cause arrhythmias, or irregular heart- beats. The contrast medium is then injected into the pul- monary artery where it circulates through the lung capil- laries. The test typically takes up to 90 minutes. | No
4337 | Title | Kidney angiography | No
4338 | NarrativeText | Patients with chronic renal disease or injury can suf- fer further damage to their kidneys from the contrast medium used in a kidney angiogram, yet they often require the test to evaluate kidney function. These patients should be well-hydrated with a intravenous saline drip before the procedure, and may benefit from available medications (e.g., dopamine) that help to pro- tect the kidney from further injury due to contrast agents. During a kidney angiogram, the guide wire and catheter are inserted into the femoral artery in the groin area and advanced through the abdominal aorta, the main artery in the abdomen, and into the renal arteries. The procedure will take approximately one hour. | No
4339 | Title | Fluorescein angiography | No
4340 | NarrativeText | Fluorescein angiography is used to diagnose retinal problems and circulatory disorders. It is typically con- ducted as an outpatient procedure. The patient’s pupils are dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin and fore- head against a bracing apparatus to keep it still. Sodium fluorescein dye is then injected with a syringe into a vein in the patient’s arm. The dye will travel through the patient’s body and into the blood vessels of the eye. The procedure does not require x rays. Instead, a rapid series of close-up photographs of the patient’s eyes are taken, one set immediately after the dye is injected, and a sec- ond set approximately 20 minutes later once the dye has moved through the patient’s vascular system. The entire procedure takes up to one hour. | No
4341 | Title | Celiac and mesenteric angiography | No
4342 | NarrativeText | Celiac and mesenteric angiography involves x-ray exploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries, arterial branches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood to the abdomen and digestive system. The test is commonly used to detect aneurysm, thrombosis, and signs of ischemia in the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and to locate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, includ- ing portal hypertension, and cirrhosis. The procedure can take up to three hours, depending on the number of blood vessels studied. | No

4366 | Title | Aftercare | No
4367 | NarrativeText | Because life-threatening internal bleeding is a possi- ble complication of an arterial puncture, an overnight stay in the hospital is sometimes recommended following an angiography procedure, particularly with cerebral and coronary angiograms. If the procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, the patient is typically kept under close observation for a period of at six to 12 hours before being released. If the arterial puncture was performed in the femoral artery, the patient will be instructed to keep his leg straight and relatively immobile during the observa- tion period. The patient’s blood pressure and vital signs will be monitored and the puncture site observed closely. Pain medication may be prescribed if the patient is expe- riencing discomfort from the puncture, and a cold pack is applied to the site to reduce swelling. It is normal for the puncture site to be sore and bruised for several weeks. | No
4368 | Title | 199 | No
4369 | NarrativeText | The patient may also develop a hematoma, a hard mass created by the blood vessels broken during the procedure. Hematomas should be watched carefully, as they may indicate continued bleeding of the arterial puncture site. | No
4370 | NarrativeText | Angiography patients are also advised to enjoy two to three days of rest and relaxation after the procedure in order to avoid placing any undue stress on the arterial puncture. Patients who experience continued bleeding or abnormal swelling of the puncture site, sudden dizziness, or chest pains in the days following an angiography pro- cedure should seek medical attention immediately. | No
4371 | NarrativeText | Patients undergoing a fluorescein angiography should not drive or expose their eyes to direct sunlight for 12 hours following the procedure. | No
4372 | Title | Risks | No
4373 | NarrativeText | Because angiography involves puncturing an artery, internal bleeding or hemorrhage are possible complica- tions of the test. As with any invasive procedure, infec- tion of the puncture site or bloodstream is also a risk, but this is rare. | No
4374 | NarrativeText | A stroke or heart attack may be triggered by an angiogram if blood clots or plaque on the inside of the arterial wall are dislodged by the catheter and form a blockage in the blood vessels or artery. The heart may also become irritated by the movement of the catheter through its chambers during pulmonary and coronary angiography procedures, and arrhythmias may develop. | No
4375 | NarrativeText | Patients who develop an allergic reaction to the con- trast medium used in angiography may experience a vari- ety of symptoms, including swelling, difficulty breath- ing, heart failure, or a sudden drop in blood pressure. If the patient is aware of the allergy before the test is administered, certain medications can be administered at that time to counteract the reaction. | No
4376 | NarrativeText | Angiography involves minor exposure to radiation through the x rays and fluoroscopic guidance used in the procedure. Unless the patient is pregnant, or multiple radiological or fluoroscopic studies are required, the small dose of radiation incurred during a single proce- dure poses little risk. However, multiple studies requiring fluoroscopic exposure that are conducted in a short time period have been known to cause skin necrosis in some individuals. This risk can be minimized by careful moni- toring and documentation of cumulative radiation doses administered to these patients. | No

4388 | Title | Definition | No
4389 | NarrativeText | Angioplasty is a term describing a procedure used to widen vessels narrowed by stenoses or occlusions. There are various types of these procedures and their names are associated with the type of vessel entry and equipment used. For example, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) describes entry through the skin (percutaneous) and navigates to the area of the vessel of interest through the same vessel or one that communicates with it (translumi- nal). In the case of a procedure involving the coronary arteries, the point of entry could be the femoral artery in the groin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed through the aorta to the heart and the origin of the coronary arteries at the base of the aorta just outside the aortic valve. | No
4390 | Title | Purpose | No
4391 | NarrativeText | In individuals with an occulsive vascular disease such as atherosclerosis, blood flow is impaired to an organ (such as the heart) or to a distal body part ( such as the lower leg) by the narrowing of the vessel’s lumen due to fatty deposits or calcium accumulation. This narrow- ing may occur in any vessel but may occur anywhere. Once the vessel has been widened, adequate blood flow is returned. The vessel may narrow again over time at the same location and the procedure could be repeated. | No

4393 | Title | Precautions | No
4394 | NarrativeText | Angioplasty procedures are performed on hospital inpatients in facilities for proper monitoring and recov- ery. If the procedure is to be performed in a coronary artery, the patient’s care is likely to be provided by spe- cially trained physicians, nurses, and vascular specialists. Typically, patients are given anticoagulants prior to the procedure to assist in the prevention of thromboses (blood clots). Administration of anticoagulants, however, may impede the sealing of the vascular entry point. The procedure will be performed using fluoroscopic guidance and contrast media. Since the decision to perform angio- plasty may have been made following a diagnostic angiogram, the patient’s sensitivity to iodinated contrast media is likely to known. The procedure may then require the use of non-ionic contrast agents. | No
4395 | Title | Description | No
4396 | NarrativeText | Angioplasty was originally performed by dilating the vessel with the introduction of larger and larger stiff catheters through the narrowed space. Complications of this procedure caused researchers to develop means of widening the vessel using a minimally sized device. Today, catheters contain balloons that are inflated to widen the vessel and stents to provide structural support for the vessel. Lasers may be used to assist in the break up of the fat or calcium plaque. Catheters may also be equipped with spinning wires or drill tips to clean out the plaque. | No
4397 | NarrativeText | involved. If a percutaneous transluminal coronary angio- plasty (PTCA) is to be performed, the patient will be kept awake to report on discomfort and cough if required. PTCA procedures are performed in cardiac catheterization labs with sophisticated monitoring devices. If angioplasty is performed in the radiology department’s angiographic suite, the patient may be sedated for the procedure and a nurse will monitor the patient’s vital signs during the procedure. If performed by a vascular surgeon, the angioplasty procedure will be performed in an operating room or specially designed vascular procedure suite. | No
4398 | NarrativeText | The site of the introduction of the angioplasty equip- ment is prepared as a sterile surgical site. Although many procedures are performed by puncturing the vessel through skin, many procedures are also performed by surgically exposing the site of entry. Direct view of the vessel’s puncture site aids in monitoring damage to the vessel or excessive bleeding at the site. Once the vessel is punctured and the guidewire is introduced, fluoroscopy is used to monitor small injections of contrast media used to visualize the path through the vessel. If the fluo- roscopy system has a feature called ‘roadmap’, the amount of contrast media injected will be greater in order to define the full route the guidewire will take. The fluo- roscopy system will then superimpose subsequent images over the roadmap while the vessel is traversed, that is, the physician moves the guidewire along the map to the destination. | No
4399 | NarrativeText | Angioplasty may be performed while the patient is sedated or anesthetized, depending on the vessels Having reached the area of stenosis, the physician will inflate the balloon on the catheter that has been | No
4400 | Title | Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors | No
4401 | NarrativeText | passed along the guidewire. Balloons are inflated in size and duration depending on the size and location of the vessel. In some cases, the use of a stent (a mesh of wire that resembles a Chinese finger puzzle) may also be used. The vessel may be widened before, during, or after the deployment of the stent. Procedures for deploying stents are dependent on the type of stent used. In cases where the vessel is tortuous or at intersections of vessels, the use of a graph may be necessary to provide structural strength to the vessel. Stents, graphs, and balloon dila- tion may all be used together or separately. | No
4402 | NarrativeText | The procedure is verified using fluoroscopy and contrast media to produce an angiogram or by using intravascular ultrasound or both. All equipment is with- drawn from the vessel and the puncture site repaired. | No
4403 | Title | Risks | No
4404 | NarrativeText | During the procedure there is a danger of puncturing the vessel with the guidewire. This is a very small risk. Patients must be monitored for hematoma or hemorrhage at the puncture site. There is also a small risk of heart attack, emboli, and although unlikely death. Hospital- ization will vary in length by the patient’s overall condi- tion, any complications, and availability of home care. | No

4428 | NarrativeText | Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (also called ACE inhibitors) are medicines that block the con- version of the chemical angiotensin I to a substance that increases salt and water retention in the body. | No
4429 | Title | Purpose | No
4430 | NarrativeText | ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of high blood pressure. They may be used alone or in combina- tion with other medicines for high blood pressure. They work by preventing a chemical in the blood, angiotensin I, from being converted into a substance that increases salt and water retention in the body. Increased salt and water retention lead to high blood pressure. ACE inhibitors also make blood vessels relax, which helps lower blood pressure and allows more oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart. | No
4431 | NarrativeText | Treating high blood pressure is important because the condition puts a burden on the heart and the arteries, which can lead to permanent damage over time. If untreated, high blood pressure increases the risk of heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, or kidney failure. | No
4432 | NarrativeText | ACE inhibitors may also be prescribed for other conditions. For example, captopril (Capoten) is used to treat kidney problems in people who take insulin to con- trol diabetes. Captopril and lisinopril are also given to some patients after a heart attack. Heart attacks dam- age and weaken the heart muscle, and the damage con- tinues even after a person recovers from the attack. This medicine helps slow down further damage to the heart. ACE inhibitors also may be used to treat congestive heart failure. | No
4433 | Title | Description | No
4434 | NarrativeText | ACE inhibitors are available only with a physician’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, and injectable forms. Some commonly used ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace) and trandolapril (Mavik). | No
4435 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
4436 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of ACE inhibitor and the medical condition for which it is being taken. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage. | No
4437 | NarrativeText | This medicine may take weeks to noticeably lower blood pressure. Take it exactly as directed. | No
4438 | NarrativeText | Do not stop taking this medicine without checking with the physician who prescribed it. | No
4439 | Title | Precautions | No
4440 | NarrativeText | A person taking an ACE inhibitor should see a physician regularly. The physician will check the blood pressure to make sure the medicine is working as it should and will note any unwanted side effects. People who have high blood pressure often feel perfectly fine. However, they should continue to see their physicians even when they feel well so that the physician can keep a close watch on their condition. It is also important for patients to keep taking their medicine even when they feel fine. | No
4441 | NarrativeText | ACE inhibitors will not cure high blood pressure, but will help control the condition. To avoid the serious health problems that high blood pressure can cause, patients may have to take medicine for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough. Patients with high blood pressure may also need to avoid certain foods, such as salty snacks, and keep their weight under control. The health care professional who is treat- ing the condition can offer advice on what measures may be necessary. Patients being treated for high blood pres- sure should not change their diets without consulting their physicians. | No
4442 | NarrativeText | Anyone taking this medicine for high blood pressure should not take any other prescription or over-the- counter (OTC) medicine without first checking with his or her physician. Some medicines, such as certain cold remedies, may increase blood pressure. | No
4443 | NarrativeText | Some people feel dizzy or lightheaded after taking the first dose of an ACE inhibitor, especially if they have been taking a water pill (diuretic). Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else that might be dangerous until they have found out how the drugs affect them. Such symptoms should be reported to the physician or pharmacist if they do not subside within a day or so. For the first one or two days of taking an ACE inhibitor, patients may become lightheaded when arising from bed in the morning. Patienst should rise slowly to a sitting posi- tion before standing up. | No
4444 | NarrativeText | While a goal of treatment with an ACE inhibitor is to lower the blood pressure, patients must be careful not to let their blood pressure get too low. Low blood pressure can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting. To prevent the blood pressure from getting too low, observe these precautions: * Do not drink alcohol without checking with the physi- cian who prescribed this medicine. | No
4445 | ListItem | * Captopril and moexipril should be taken one hour before meals. Other ACE inhinbitors may be taken with or without meals. | No
4446 | ListItem | + Avoid overheating when exercising or in hot weather. The loss of water from the body through heavy sweat- ing can cause low blood pressure. | No
4447 | ListItem | * Check with a physician right away if illness occurs while taking an ACE inhibitor. This is especially true if the illness involves severe nausea, vomiting, or diar- rhea. Vomiting and diarrhea can cause the loss of too much water from the body, which can lead to low blood pressure. | No
4448 | NarrativeText | Anyone who is taking ACE inhibitors should be sure to tell the health care professional in charge before hav- ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer- gency treatment. | No
4449 | Title | enzyme inhibitors | No
4450 | NarrativeText | Some ACE inhibitors may change the results of cer- tain medical tests, such as blood or urine tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care professional in charge. | No
4451 | NarrativeText | Do not use a potassium supplement or a salt substi- tute that contains potassium without first checking with the physician who prescribed the ACE inhibitor. | No

4453 | Title | Special conditions | No
4454 | NarrativeText | People with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take ACE inhibitors. Before taking these drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of these conditions. | No
4455 | NarrativeText | ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to an ACE inhibitor in the past should let his or her physician know before taking this type of medicine again. The physician should also be told about any aller- gies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
4456 | NarrativeText | PREGNANCY. The use of ACE inhibitors in preg- nancy can cause serious problems and even death in the fetus or newborn. Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should check with their physicians before using this medicine. Women who become preg- nant while taking this medicine should check with their physicians immediately. | No
4457 | NarrativeText | BREASTFEEDING. Some ACE inhibitors pass into breast milk. Women who are breastfeeding should check with their physicians before using ACE inhibitors. | No
4458 | NarrativeText | OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ACE inhibitors, people with any of these medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of their con- ditions: + diabetes + heart or blood vessel disease | No

4465 | NarrativeText | The most common side effect is a dry, continuing cough. This usually does not subside unless the medica- tion is stopped. Ask the physician if the cough can be treated. Less common side effects, such as headache, loss of taste, unusual tiredness, and nausea or diarrhea also may occur and do not need medical attention unless they are severe or they interfere with normal activities. | No
4466 | NarrativeText | More serious side effects are rare, but may occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check with a physician immediately: * swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, legs, hands, or feet itchy skin | No

4493 | NarrativeText | This test measures blood levels of angiotensin-con- verting enzyme (ACE), also known as Serum Angiotensin- Converting Enzyme (SASE). The primary function of ACE is to help regulate arterial pressure by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. | No
4494 | Title | Purpose | No
4495 | NarrativeText | The ACE test is used primarily to detect and monitor the clinical course of sarcoidosis (a disease that affects many organs, especially the lungs), to differentiate between sarcoidosis and similar diseases, and to delin- eate between active and inactive sarcoid disease. Elevat- ed ACE levels are also found in a number of other condi- tions, including Gaucher’s disease (a rare familial disor- der of fat metabolism) and leprosy. | No
4496 | Title | Precautions | No
4497 | NarrativeText | It should be noted that people under 20 years of age normally have very high ACE levels. Decreased levels may be seen in the condition of excess fat in the blood (hyper- lipidemia). Drugs that may cause decreased ACE levels include ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids. | No
4498 | Title | Description | No
4499 | NarrativeText | ACE plays an important role in the renin/aldosterone mechanism which controls blood pressure by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, two proteins involved in regulating blood pressure. Angiotensin I by itself is inac- tive, but when converted by ACE to the active form, angiotensin II, it causes narrowing of the small blood vessels in tissues, resulting in an increase in blood pres- sure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the hormone aldos- terone, which causes an increase in blood pressure. Cer- tain kidney disorders increase the production of angiotensin II, another cause of hypertension. Despite the action of ACE on blood pressure regulation, determi- nation of this enzyme is not very helpful in the evaluation of hypertension (high blood pressure). | No

4518 | NarrativeText | The most common problem following an animal bite is simple infection. The saliva of dogs and cats is known to contain a wide variety of bacteria. According to one recent study, bacteria or other pathogens show up in about 85 percent of bites. When an animal bites, it can then transmit pathogens into the wound. These microor- ganisms may grow within the wound and cause an infec- tion. The consequences of infection range from mild dis- comfort to life-threatening complications. | No
4519 | Title | Description | No
4520 | NarrativeText | Two to 4.5 million animal bites occur each year in the United States and about 1% of bites require hospital- ization. Animal bites result in 334,000 emergency room visits per year, which represents approximately 1% of all emergency hospital visits, at an annual cost of $100 mil- lion dollars in health care expenses and lost income. | No
4521 | Title | 206 | No
4522 | NarrativeText | Children are the most frequent victims of dog bites, with 5-9 year-old boys having the highest incidence. Men are more often bitten by dogs than are women (3:1), whereas women are more often bitten by cats (3:1). | No
4523 | NarrativeText | Dog bites make up 80-85% of all reported incidents. Cats account for about 10% of reported bites, and other animals (including rodents, rabbits, horses, raccoons, bats, skunks, and monkeys) make up the remaining 5- 10%. Cat bites become infected more frequently than dog bites. A dog’s mouth is rich in bacteria, but only 15- 20% of dog bites become infected. In contrast, approxi- mately 30-50% of cat bites become infected. | No
4524 | NarrativeText | Many factors contribute to the infection rates, such as, for example, the type of wound inflicted, the location of the wound, pre-existing health conditions in the bitten person, the extent of delay before treatment, patient com- pliance and the presence of a foreign body in the wound. Dogs usually inflict crush injuries because they have rounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the bite of an adult dog can exert up to 200 pounds per square inch of pres- sure. This pressure usually results in a crushing injury, causing damage to deep structures such as bones, blood vessels, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Dog canine teeth are also sharp and strong and also inflict lacerations. Cats, with their needle-like fangs, typically cause punc- ture wounds. Puncture wounds appear innocuous on the surface, but the underlying injury goes deep. Cat teeth essentially inject bacteria into the bite, and the deep, nar- row wound is difficult to clean. Persons with impaired immunocompetence—for example, individuals with HIV infection—are especially vulnerable to infection. | No
4525 | NarrativeText | The bacterial species most commonly found in bite wounds include Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas sp, and Streptococcus sp. P. multoci- da, the root cause of pasteurellosis, is especially prominent in cat bite infections. Other infectious diseases from animal bites include cat-scratch disease, tetanus and rabies. | No
4526 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
4527 | NarrativeText | The most common sign of infection from an animal bite is inflammation. The skin around the wound is red and feels warm, and the wound may exude pus. Nearby lymph glands may be swollen. Complications can arise if the infection is not treated and spreads into deeper struc- tures or into the bloodstream. If the bite is deep or occurs on the hand or at a joint, complications are more likely. | No
4528 | NarrativeText | Live, disease-causing bacteria within the blood- stream and tissues cause complications far from the wound site. Such complications include meningitis, brain abscesses, pneumonia and lung abscesses, and heart infections, among others. These complications can be fatal. Deep bites or bites near joints can damage joints and bones, causing inflammation of the bone and bone matrow or septic arthritis. | No
4529 | NarrativeText | Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella hense- Jae, a bacterium that is carried in cat saliva; infection may be transmitted by a bite or scratch. Approximately 22,000 cases are reported each year in the United States; worldwide, nine out of every 100,000 individuals become infected. More than 80% of reported cases occur in persons under the age of 21. The disease is not nor- mally severe in individuals with healthy immune sys- tems. Symptoms may become serious, however, in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those undergoing chemotherapy. Common symptoms include an inflamed sore in the area of the bite or scratch, swollen lymph nodes, fever, fatigue, and rash. | No
4530 | NarrativeText | Rabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted through the bite of an animal that is already infected. More than 90% of animal rabies cases occur in wild animals such as skunks, bats, and raccoons, with domestic animals such as dogs and cats accounting for less than 10%. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 35,000 and 50,000 individuals worldwide die each year as aresult of rabies. The highest incidence of rabies occurs in Asia where, in 1997, over 33,000 deaths were noted, most occurring in India. Rabies is nowadays rare in the U.S. due to good animal control practice. The delay of onset is usu- ally weeks to months after being bitten. Early symptoms of rabies include fever, headache, and flu-like symptoms. These progress to anxiety, hallucinations, muscle spasms, partial paralysis, fear of water (hydrophobia), and other neurological symptoms as the virus spreads to the central nervous system. Medical treatment must be sought soon after exposure because death invariably follows once the infection becomes established. | No
4531 | Title | Diagnosis | No
4532 | NarrativeText | A medical examination involves taking the history of the injury and assessing the wound type and damage. Tetanus immunization and general health status are checked. An x ray may be ordered to assess bone damage and to check for foreign objects in the wound. Wound cultures are done for infected bites if the victim is at high risk for complications or if the infection does not respond to treatment. Evaluation of possible exposure to rabies is also important. A biting animal suspected of having rabies is usually apprehended, tested, and observed for a period of time for evidence of pre-existing infection. | No

4536 | NarrativeText | If infection occurs, antibiotics are prescribed. Antibiotics may also be used for infection prevention. Since a single bite wound may contain many different types of bacteria, no single antibiotic is always effective. Commonly prescribed antibiotics are penicillin or a com- bination of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. | No
4537 | NarrativeText | Because rabies is caused by a virus, antibiotics are not effective. In addition, as of 2001, there is no known cure for the disease once symptoms become apparent. It is therefore recommended that individuals with a high risk of contracting the disease (veterinarians, animal han- dlers, some laboratory workers) receive preexposure vac- KEY TERMS Canines—tThe two sharp teeth located next to the front incisor teeth in mammals that are used to grip and tear. | No

An animal that is unusually aggressive or behaving strangely (e.g. a raccoon that is active during the day- time) should be avoided and reported to the local animal control authorities; it may be infected with the rabies virus. All pets should be vaccinated against rabies and wild animals should not be taken in as pets. People should also avoid trying to break up fights between ani- mals and should as a rule approach unknown cats and dogs very cautiously, especially on their territory. Final- ly, animals should not be trained to fight. | No

4576 | NarrativeText | AS is seen most commonly in males 30 years old and older. Initial symptoms are uncommon after the age of 30, although the diagnosis may not be established until after that age. The incidence of AS in Afro-Ameri- cans is about 25% of the incidence in Caucasians. | No
4577 | Title | Diagnosis | No
4578 | NarrativeText | Doctors usually diagnose the disease simply by the patient’s report of pain and stiffness. Doctors also review spinal and pelvic x rays since involvement of the hip and pelvic joints is common and may be the first abnormality seen on the x ray. The doctor may also order a blood test to determine the presence of HLA-B27 antigen. When a diagnosis is made, patients may be referred to a rheuma- tologist, a doctor who specializes in treating arthritis. Patients may also be referred to an orthopedic surgeon, a doctor who can surgically correct joint or bone disorders. | No
4579 | Title | Treatment | No
4580 | NarrativeText | Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like naproxen (Naprosyn) or indomethacin (Indocin) are used to relieve pain and stiffness. In severe cases, sul- fasalazine (Azulfidine), another drug to reduce inflam- mation, or methotrexate (Rheumatrex), an immune-sup- pressing drug, is recommended. In cases where chronic therapy is needed, potential drug side effects must be taken into consideration. Corticosteroid drugs are effec- tive in relieving symptoms, but are usually reserved for severe cases that do not improve when NSAIDs are used. To avoid potential side effects, treatment with corticos- teroids is usually limited to a short amount of time with a gradual weaning from the drug. | No
4581 | NarrativeText | Physical therapists prescribe exercises to prevent a stooped posture and breathing problems when the spine starts to fuse and ribs are affected. Back braces may be used to prevent continued deformity of the spine and ribs. Only in severe cases of deformity is surgery per- formed to straighten and realign the spine, or to replace knee, shoulder, or hip joints. | No

4610 | NarrativeText | The anal canal, also called the anus, is the opening at the bottom end of the digestive tract and is a combination of external skin and tissue from the digestive tract. It has many sensory nerves and is sensitive to pain. The rectum is the last section of the digestive tract and has a mucus layer as its inside surface. It has very few sensory nerves and is, therefore, relatively insensitive to pain. The anal canal has a ring of muscle, called the anal sphincter, which keeps the anus closed. There are a number of dif- ferent anorectal disorders. | No

4612 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
4613 | NarrativeText | Hemorrhoids are swollen or varicose veins in the anal canal and rectum. They may become inflamed, enlarged, or protrude from the anorectal area. Hemor- rhoids may bleed when passing a bowel movement. The amount of bleeding is typically small. Frequently, hem- orrhoids develop because of straining during bowel movements, especially if the person has constipation. | No
4614 | NarrativeText | An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus that is usually caused by a hard bowel movement. Fissures are painful and bleed when the tissue is stressed during bowel movements. | No
4615 | NarrativeText | Anorectal abscesses are characterized by pus-form- ing infections in the anorectal region. Painful abscesses form under the skin. | No
4616 | NarrativeText | An anorectal fistula is an abnormal opening or chan- nel from the anorectal area to another part of the body. Typically, the channel leads to pockets of skin near the anus. When seen in infants, anorectal fistulas are consid- ered birth defects. These are seen more frequently in boys than in girls. Fistulas are also seen more frequently in people who have other diseases, including Crohn’s disease, tuberculosis, cancer, and diverticulitis. Anorec- tal fistulas also occur following anorectal abscesses or other injury to the anal area. Fistulas are usually painful and discharge pus. | No
4617 | NarrativeText | Proctitis is an inflammation of the internal mucosal lining of the rectum. Ulcers of the lining may form and develop into ulcerative colitis. There are many causes of proctitis, including the sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia and herpes simplex infections. Proctitis is fre- quently seen in homosexual males as a consequence of anorectal infection. Proctitis itself is not painful, but pain may be caused by the infectious agent. | No
4618 | Title | Diagnosis | No
4619 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis is made by visual inspection of the skin around the anus. Also, the doctor may probe the rectum with a gloved finger. An anoscope is a short instrument that allows the physician to view the inside of the anus. A proctoscope is a longer, rigid viewing tube of approxi- mately six to ten inches in length, which may be used to look for anorectal disorders. A sigmoidoscope is a longer, flexible tube, that allows the physician to view up to about two feet of the inside of the large intestine. Tis- sue samples and material for microbial culture may be obtained during the examination. | No
4620 | Title | Treatment | No
4621 | NarrativeText | Treatment usually isn’t required for hemorrhoids. Most hemorrhoids will heal if the patient takes stool soft- eners to relieve the constipation. Enlarged blood vessels can be eliminated by surgery if they are considered a severe problem. In the case of fissures, treatment involves stool softeners that eliminate stress on the fis- sure during bowel movements, which allows the fissure to heal. If the fissure doesn’t heal, surgery is required. Treatment for anorectal abscesses consists of cutting the abscess and draining the pus. Fistulas are treated by surgery.The usual treatment for proctitis is antibiotics. | No

4630 | NarrativeText | Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by unrealistic fear of weight gain, self-starvation, and conspicuous distortion of body image. The name comes from two Latin words that mean nervous inability to eat. In females who have begun to menstruate, anorexia ner- vosa is usually marked by amenorrhea, or skipping at least three menstrual periods in a row. The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders, or DSM-IV (1994), defines two subtypes of anorexia nervosa—a restricting type, characterized by strict dieting and exercise without binge eating; and a binge-eating/purging type, marked by episodes of com- pulsive eating with or without self-induced vomiting and the use of laxatives or enemas. DSM-IV defines a binge as a time-limited (usually under two hours) episode of compulsive eating in which the individual consumes a significantly larger amount of food than most people would eat in similar circumstances. | No
4631 | Title | Description | No
4632 | NarrativeText | Anorexia nervosa was not officially classified as a psychiatric disorder until the third edition of DSM in 1980. It is, however, a growing problem among adoles- cent females. Its incidence in the United States has dou- bled since 1970. The rise in the number of reported cases reflects a genuine increase in the number of persons affected by the disorder, and not simply earlier or more accurate diagnosis. Estimates of the incidence of anorex- ia range between 0.5-1% of caucasian female adoles- cents. Over 90% of patients diagnosed with the disorder as of 1998 are female. It was originally thought that only 5% of anorexics are male, but that estimate is being revised upward. The peak age range for onset of the dis- order is 14-18 years, although there are patients who develop anorexia as late as their 40s. In the 1970s and 1980s, anorexia was regarded as a disorder of upper- and middle-class women, but that generalization is also changing. More recent studies indicate that anorexia is increasingly common among women of all races and social classes in the United States. | No
4633 | NarrativeText | Anorexia nervosa is a serious public health problem not only because of its rising incidence, but also because it has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder. Moreover, the disorder may cause serious long- term health complications, including congestive heart failure, sudden death, growth retardation, dental prob- lems, constipation, stomach rupture, swelling of the salivary glands, anemia and other abnormalities of the blood, loss of kidney function, and osteoporosis. | No
4634 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
4635 | NarrativeText | Anorexia is a disorder that results from the interac- tion of cultural and interpersonal as well as biological factors. While the precise cause of the disease is not known, it has been linked to the following: Social influences The rising incidence of anorexia is thought to reflect the present idealization of thinness as a badge of upper- class status as well as of female beauty. In addition, the increase in cases of anorexia includes “copycat” behav- ior, with some patients developing the disorder from imi- tating other girls. | No
4636 | NarrativeText | The onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed to a developmental crisis caused by girls’ changing bodies coupled with society’s overemphasis on women’s looks. The increasing influence of the mass media in spreading and reinforcing gender stereotypes has also been noted. | No
4637 | Title | Occupational goals | No
4638 | NarrativeText | The risk of developing anorexia is higher among adolescents preparing for careers that require attention to weight and/or appearance. These high-risk groups include dancers, fashion models, professional athletes (including gymnasts, skaters, long-distance runners, and jockeys), and actresses. | No
4639 | Title | Genetic and biological influences | No
4640 | NarrativeText | Women whose biological mothers or sisters have the disorder appear to be at increased risk. | No
4641 | Title | Psychological factors | No
4642 | NarrativeText | A number of theories have been advanced to explain the psychological aspects of the disorder. No single explanation covers all cases. Anorexia nervosa has been interpreted as: ¢ A rejection of female sexual maturity. This rejection is variously interpreted as a desire to remain a child, or as a desire to resemble men as closely as possible. | No
4643 | ListItem | A reaction to sexual abuse or assault. | No
4644 | ListItem | + A desire to appear as fragile and nonthreatening as pos- sible. This hypothesis reflects the idea that female pas- sivity and weakness are attractive to men. | No
4645 | ListItem | * Overemphasis on control, autonomy, and indepen- dence. Some anorexics come from achievement-orient- ed families that stress physical fitness and dieting. Many anorexics are perfectionistic and “driven” about schoolwork and other matters in addition to weight control. | No
4646 | ListItem | ¢ Evidence of family dysfunction. In some families, a daughter’s eating disorder serves as a distraction from marital discord or other family tensions. | No
4647 | ListItem | + Inability to interpret the body’s hunger signals accu- rately due to early experiences of inappropriate feeding. | No
4648 | Title | Male anorexics | No
4649 | NarrativeText | Although anorexia nervosa is still considered a dis- order that largely affects women, its incidence in the male population is rising. Less is known about the causes of anorexia in males, but some risk factors are the same as for females. These include certain occupational goals and increasing media emphasis on external appearance in men. Moreover, homosexual males are under pressure to conform to an ideal body weight that is about 20 pounds lighter than the standard “attractive” weight for hetero- sexual males. | No
4650 | Title | Diagnosis | No
4651 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by a number of factors. One is that the disorder varies some- what in severity from patient to patient. A second factor is denial, which is regarded as an early sign of the disor- der. Most anorexics deny that they are ill and are usually brought to treatment by a family member. | No
4652 | NarrativeText | Most anorexics are diagnosed by pediatricians or family practitioners. Anorexics develop emaciated bod- ies, dry or yellowish skin, and abnormally low blood pressure. There is usually a history of amenorrhea (fail- ure to menstruate) in females, and sometimes of abdomi- nal pain, constipation, or lack of energy. The patient may feel chilly or have developed lanugo, a growth of downy body hair. If the patient has been vomiting, she may have eroded tooth enamel or Russell’s sign (scars on the back of the hand). The second step in diagnosis is measure- ment of the patient’s weight loss. DSM-IV specifies a weight loss leading to a body weight 15% below normal, with some allowance for body build and weight history. | No
4653 | NarrativeText | The doctor will need to rule out other physical condi- tions that can cause weight loss or vomiting after eating, including metabolic disorders, brain tumors (especially hypothalamus and pituitary gland lesions), diseases of the digestive tract, and a condition called superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Persons with this condition sometimes vomit after meals because the blood supply to the intes- tine is blocked. The doctor will usually order blood tests, an electrocardiogram, urinalysis, and bone densitometry (bone density test) in order to exclude other diseases and to assess the patient’s nutritional status. | No
4654 | NarrativeText | The doctor will also need to distinguish between anorexia and other psychiatric disorders, including depres- sion, schizophrenia, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Two diagnostic tests that are often used are the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI). | No
4655 | Title | Treatment | No
4656 | NarrativeText | Treatment of anorexia nervosa includes both short- and long-term measures, and requires assessment by dietitians and psychiatrists as well as medical specialists. Therapy is often complicated by the patient’s resistance or failure to carry out treatment plan. | No
4657 | Title | Hospital treatment | No
4658 | NarrativeText | Hospitalization is recommended for anorexics with any of the following characteristics: * weight of 40% or more below normal; or weight loss over a three-month period of more than 30 pounds * severely disturbed metabolism | No
4659 | ListItem | * severe binging and purging + signs of psychosis | No
4660 | ListItem | * severe depression or risk of suicide + family in crisis | No
4661 | NarrativeText | Hospital treatment includes individual and group therapy as well as refeeding and monitoring of the patient’s physical condition. Treatment usually requires two to four months in the hospital. In extreme cases, hos- pitalized patients may be force-fed through a tube insert- ed in the nose (nasogastric tube) or by over-feeding (hyperalimentation techniques). | No
4662 | Title | Outpatient treatment | No
4663 | NarrativeText | Anorexics who are not severely malnourished can be treated by outpatient psychotherapy. The types of treat- ment recommended are supportive rather than insight-ori- ented, and include behavioral approaches as well as indi- vidual or group therapy. Family therapy is often recom- mended when the patient’s eating disorder is closely tied to family dysfunction. Self-help groups are often useful in helping anorexics find social support and encouragement. Psychotherapy with anorexics is a slow and difficult process; about 50% of patients continue to have serious psychiatric problems after their weight has stabilized. | No
4664 | Title | Medications | No
4665 | NarrativeText | Anorexics have been treated with a variety of med- ications, including antidepressants, antianxiety drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and lithium carbonate. The effectiveness of medications in treatment regimens is still debated. However, at least one study of Prozac showed it helped the patient maintain weight gained while in the hospital. | No
4666 | Title | Prognosis | No
4667 | NarrativeText | Figures for long-term recovery vary from study to study, but the most reliable estimates are that 40-60% of anorexics will make a good physical and social recovery, and 75% will gain weight. The long-term mortality rate for anorexia is estimated at around 10%, although some studies give a lower figure of 3-4%. The most frequent causes of death associated with anorexia are starvation, electrolyte imbalance, heart failure, and suicide. | No
4668 | Title | Prevention | No
4669 | NarrativeText | Short of major long-term changes in the larger soci- ety, the best strategy for prevention of anorexia is the cul- tivation of healthy attitudes toward food, weight control, and beauty (or body image) within families. | No

4696 | NarrativeText | An anoscopy is an examination of the rectum in which a small tube is inserted into the anus to screen, diag- nose, and evaluate problems of the anus and anal canal. | No
4697 | Title | Purpose | No
4698 | NarrativeText | This test may be ordered for the evaluation of peri- anal or anal pain, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, digital rectal examination that shows a mass, perianal abscess and condyloma (a wart-like growth). An anascopy may be performed to check for abnormal openings between the anus and the skin, or anal fissures. The test is also used to diagnose rectal cancer. | No
4699 | Title | Precautions | No
4700 | NarrativeText | Anoscopy should not be performed on patients with acute cardiovascular problems due to the vasovagal reac- tion it may cause. This test is also not recommended for patients with acute abdominal problems and those with a constricted or narrowed anal canal. | No
4701 | Title | Description | No
4702 | NarrativeText | Anoscopy views the anus and anal canal by using an anoscope. An anoscope is a plastic, tube-shaped specu- lum that is a smaller version of a sigmoidscope. Before the anoscope is used, the doctor completes a digital rectal examination with a lubricated, gloved index finger. The anoscope is then lubricated and gently inserted a few inches into the rectum. This procedure enlarges the rec- tum to allow the doctor to view the entire anal canal with a light. If any suspicious areas are noticed, a piece of tis- sue can be biopsied. | No
4703 | NarrativeText | During the anoscopy procedure there may be a feel- ing of pressure or the need to go to the bathroom. If a biopsy is taken, the patient may feel a slight pinch. The procedure is performed on an out-patient basis, and takes approximately an hour to complete. | No

4732 | NarrativeText | The term anosmia means lack of the sense of smell. It may also refer to a decreased sense of smell. Ageusia, a companion word, refers to a lack of taste sensation. Patients who actually have anosmia may complain wrongly of ageusia, although they retain the ability to distinguish salt, sweet, sour, and bitter—humans’ only taste sensations. | No
4733 | Title | Description | No
4734 | NarrativeText | Of the five senses, smell ranks fourth in importance for humans, although it is much more pronounced in other animals. Bloodhounds, for example, can smell an odor a thousand times weaker than humans. Taste, consid- ered the fifth sense, is mostly the smell of food in the mouth. The sense of smell originates from the first cranial nerves (the olfactory nerves), which sit at the base of the brain’s frontal lobes, right behind the eyes and above the nose. Inhaled airborne chemicals stimulate these nerves. | No
4735 | NarrativeText | There are other aberrations of smell beside a decrease. Smells can be distorted, intensified, or halluci- nated. These changes usually indicate a malfunction of the brain. | No
4736 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
4737 | NarrativeText | The most common cause of anosmia is nasal occlu- sion caused by rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mem- branes). If no air gets to the olfactory nerves, smell will not happen. In turn, rhinitis and nasal polyps (growths on nasal membranes) are caused by irritants such as allergens, infections, cigarette smoke, and other air pol- lutants. Tumors such as nasal polyps can also block the nasal passages and the olfactory nerves and cause anos- mia. Head injury or, rarely, certain viral infections can damage or destroy the olfactory nerves. | No
4738 | Title | Diagnosis | No
4739 | NarrativeText | It is difficult to measure a loss of smell, and no one complains of loss of smell in just one nostril. So a physi- cian usually begins by testing each nostril separately with a common, non-irritating odor such as perfume, lemon, vanilla, or coffee. Polyps and rhinitis are obvious causal agents a physician looks for. Imaging studies of the head may be necessary in order to detect brain injury, sinus infection, or tumor. | No
4740 | Title | Treatment | No
4741 | NarrativeText | Cessation of smoking is the first step. Many smok- ers who quit discover new tastes so enthusiastically that they immediately gain weight. Attention to reducing exposure to other nasal irritants and treatment of respira- tory allergies or chronic upper respiratory infections will be beneficial. Corticosteroids are particularly helpful. | No
4742 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
4743 | NarrativeText | Finding and treating the cause of the loss of smell is the first approach in naturopathic medicine. If rhinitis is the cause, treating acute rhinitis with herbal mast cell stabilizers and herbal decongestants can offer some relief as the body heals. If chronic rhinitis is present, this is often related to an environmental irritant or to food allergies. Removal of the causative factors is the first step to healing. Nasal steams with essential oils offer relief of the blockage and tonification of the membranes. Block- ages can sometimes be resolved through naso-specific therapy—a way of realigning the nasal cavities. Polyp blockage can be addressed through botanical medicine treatment as well as hydrotherapy. Olfactory nerve damage may not be regenerable. Some olfactory aberra- tions, like intensified sense of smell, can be resolved using homeopathic medicine. | No
4744 | Title | Prognosis | No
4745 | NarrativeText | If nasal inflammation is the cause of anosmia, the chances of recovery are excellent. However, if nerve damage is the cause of the problem, the recovery of smell is much more difficult. | No

4760 | Title | Definition | No
4761 | NarrativeText | Anoxia is a condition characterized by an absence of oxygen supply to an organ or a tissue. | No
4762 | Title | Description | No
4763 | NarrativeText | Anoxia results when oxygen is not being delivered to a part of the body. If the condition does not involve total oxygen deprivation, it is often called hypoxia, although the two terms have been used interchangeably. A related condition, anoxemia, occurs when the blood circulates but contains a below normal amount of oxygen. | No
4764 | NarrativeText | The five types of anoxia or hypoxia include hypox- emic, anemic, affinity, stagnant, and histotoxic. Hypox- emic anoxia happens when the oxygen pressure outside the body is so low that the hemoglobin, the chemical which carries oxygen in the red blood cells (RBCs), is unable to become fully loaded with the gas. This results in too little oxygen reaching the tissues and can occur in suf- focation when a person is at high altitude, where the pres- sure of oxygen in the air is much less than at sea level. | No
4765 | NarrativeText | Anemic anoxia results from a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin or RBCs in the blood, which reduces the ability to get oxygen to the tissues. Anemia may result from lack of production of red blood cells | No
4766 | Title | 216 | No
4767 | NarrativeText | (iron deficiency), blood loss (hemorrhage), or shortened lifespan of red blood cells (autoimmune disease). | No
4768 | NarrativeText | Affinity anoxia involves a defect in the chemistry of the blood such that the hemoglobin can no longer pick up as much oxygen from the air, even though the quantities are normal, reducing how much is delivered to the tissues. | No
4769 | NarrativeText | Stagnant anoxia occurs when there is interference with the blood flow, although the blood and its oxygen- carrying abilities are normal. A common cause of general stagnant anoxia is heart disease or interference with the return of blood flow through the veins. Examples of local stagnant anoxia include exposure to cold, diseases that restrict circulation to the extremities, and ergot poison- ing. When the tissue or organ itself has a reduced ability to accept and use the oxygen, it is called histotoxic anox- ia. The classic example is cyanide poisoning, where the chemical inactivates a cellular enzyme necessary for the cell to use oxygen. Thus, tissue exposed to cyanide can- not use the oxygen even though it is in normal amounts in the bloodstream. Histotoxic anoxia can also be caused by exposure to narcotics, alcohol, formaldehyde, ace- tone, toluene, and certain anesthetic agents. | No
4770 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
4771 | NarrativeText | Anoxia and hypoxia can be caused by any number of disease states of the blood, lungs, heart and circulation including heart attack, severe asthma, or emphysema. It can also result from smoke or carbon monoxide inhala- tion, improper exposure to anesthesia, poisoning, strangu- lation, near-drowning, or high altitude exposure through mountain climbing or travel in an insufficiently pressur- ized airplane. Anoxia, and the resultant brain damage, is a particular problem with newborns during difficult births. | No
4772 | NarrativeText | No matter what the cause of anoxia, the symptoms are similar. In severe cases, the patient is often confused and commonly stuperous or comatose (in a state of unconsciousness). Depending on the severity of the injury to the brain, the organ most sensitive to reduced oxygen intake, this condition can persist for hours, days, weeks, or even months or years. Seizures, myoclonic jerks (invol- untary muscle spasms or twitches), and neck stiffness are some other symptoms of the anoxic condition. | No
4773 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of more localized or less complete oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) include increased breathing rate, lightheadedness, dizziness, tingling or warm sensation, sweating, reduced field of vision, sleepiness, a bluish tint to skin, particularly the fingertips and lips, and behavior changes, often an inappropriate sense of euphoria. | No
4774 | Title | Diagnosis | No
4775 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of anoxia and hypoxia is commonly made through the appearance of clinical symptoms. However, | No
4776 | NarrativeText | suspected reduction in oxygen reaching the tissues can be confirmed using laboratory tests. The exact test that is performed is dependent on the suspected cause of the anoxia. One systemic measure of tissue anoxia is the serum lactate (lactic acid) test. When cells are forced to produce energy without oxygen, as would happen during anoxia, lactic acid is one of the byproducts. Thus, an increase in lactic acid in the blood would indicate that tis- sues were starved for oxygen and are using non-oxygen pathways to produce energy. Normally, the blood con- tains less than 2mmol/L of lactic acid. However, some forms of anoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrations in the blood and some increases in lactic acid levels are not associated with anoxia, so an elevated value for this test is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic condition. | No
4777 | Title | Treatment | No
4778 | NarrativeText | The exact treatment for anoxia is dependent on the cause of the reduced oxygen reaching the tissues. How- ever, immediate restoration of tissue oxygen levels through supplementing the patient’s air supply with 100% oxygen is a common first step. Secondary steps often include support of the cardiovascular system through drugs or other treatment, treatment of lung dis- ease, transfusions, or administration of anecdotes for poi- soning, as appropriate. | No
4779 | Title | Prognosis | No
4780 | NarrativeText | A good prognosis is dependent on the ability to treat the underlying cause of the low oxygen levels. If cardio- vascular and respiratory systems can be supported ade- quately, recovery from the injury to the tissue is possible, although extent of injury to the brain can be difficult to assess. The exact amount of recovery varies with the amount of injury sustained, where significant injury brings a poorer prognosis. As recovery occurs, both psychologi- cal and neurological abnormalities may appear, persist, and can improve. Some problems seen after anoxia include mental confusion, personality changes, amnesia or other types of memory loss, hallucinations, and persis- tent myoclonus (involuntary contractions of the muscles). | No
4781 | Title | Prevention | No
4782 | NarrativeText | Hypoxemic anoxia can be avoided by utilizing sup- plemental oxygen when in high altitudes and being aware of the early symptoms of altitude sickness and reducing altitude once recognized. Iron supplements can avoid anemic hypoxia, although more severe anemic states are usually caused by disease or bleeding.

4801 | NarrativeText | Antacids are medicines that neutralize stomach acid. | No
4802 | Title | Purpose | No
4803 | NarrativeText | Antacids are used to relieve acid indigestion, upset stomach, sour stomach, and heartburn. Additional com- ponents of some formulations include dimethicone, to reduce gas pains (flatulence) and alginic acid, which, in combination with antacids, may help manage GERD (gastro-esophageal reflux disease). Antacids should not be confused with gastric acid inhibitors, such as the H-2 receptor blockers (cimetidine, ranitide and others) or the proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole, omeprazole and others). Although all three classes of drugs act to reduce the levels of gastric acid, their mechanisms are different, and this affects the appropriate use of the drug. Antacids have a rapid onset and short duration of action, and are most appropriate for rapid relief of gastric discomfort for a short period of time. | No
4804 | NarrativeText | Antacids may be divided into two classes, those that work by chemical neutralization of gastric acid, most notably sodium bicarbonate; and those that act by adsorption of the acid (non-absorbable antacids), such as calcium and magnesium salts. | No
4805 | NarrativeText | The chemical antacids show the most rapid onset of action, but may cause “acid rebound,” a condition in which the gastric acid returns in greater concentration after the drug effect has stopped. Also, since these antacids may contain high concentrations of sodium, they may be inappropriate in patients with hypertension. | No
4806 | NarrativeText | Calcium and magnesium salts act by adsorption of the acid, and are less prone to the rebound effect, but may have other significant disadvantages. These antacids are particularly prone to drug interactions, and patients taking other medications must often avoid simultaneous administration of the medications. These antacids are more effective in liquid formulations than in tablet or capsule form, and so may be inconvenient for routine dosing. | No
4807 | NarrativeText | The non-absorbable antacids may have additional uses beyond control of hyperacidity. Calcium salts may be used as diet supplements in prevention of osteoporo- sis. Aluminum carbonate is useful for binding phosphate, and has been effective in treatment and control of hyper- phosphatemia or for use with a low phosphate diet to pre- vent formation of phosphate urinary stones. This applica- tion is particularly valuable in patients with chronic renal failure. Antacids with aluminum and magnesium hydrox- ides or aluminum hydroxide alone effectively prevent significant stress ulcer bleeding in post-operative patients or those with severe burns. | No

In some cases, this can lead to permanent kidney damage. Before combining antacids with extra calcium, check with a physician. | No
4820 | NarrativeText | Some antacids contain large amounts of sodium, particularly sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Anyone who is on a low-sodium diet should check the list of ingredients or check with a physician or pharmacist before taking an antacid product. | No

4853 | NarrativeText | Unlike x rays, ultrasound is safe to use during preg- nancy. It does not cause any known side-effects that would harm the mother or baby. | No
4854 | NarrativeText | Pregnant women usually will have their first ultra- sound anytime between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. In normal cases, the technician is able to identify a fetal heartbeat, which appears as a flashing light on the screen. Closer to the due date, physicians use ultrasound to make sure the fetus is in the correct position to exit the birth canal head first. | No
4855 | NarrativeText | Sometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus has stopped growing, or a gestational sac has formed without a fetus, and a miscarriage has occurred. Later in pregnan- cy, it also may show that the child is in a breech position, oriented feet first, which can cause a difficult labor. | No
4856 | Title | Tests for birth defects | No
4857 | NarrativeText | Most obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways to find out if their developing child might have birth defects such as spina bifida and Down Syndrome. An alpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simple blood test in the doctor’s office between the 16th and 18th week of gestation. It tells the odds that their child will have a severe congenital anomaly. The test works by measuring the level of alpha fetoprotein, a substance pro- duced by a fetus with birth defects. Low levels of alpha fetoprotein in the mother’s blood may indicate Down’s Syndrome. In that case, the next step for most couples is amniocentesis because the alpha fetoprotein test can give false-positive results. Amniocentesis is a more accu- rate test, but it also has higher risks of complications. | No
4858 | NarrativeText | This procedure typically is used to diagnose Down syndrome while a developing child is still in the womb, at 15-28 weeks. | No
4859 | NarrativeText | During amniocentesis, a doctor inserts a needle through a woman’s vaginal canal and inside her cervix. Using ultrasound as a guide, the doctor pierces the uterus to withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac. Afterwards, tiny cells shed by the fetus can be studied in the laboratory. Scientists can analyze DNA samples to determine if the fetus has Down syndrome or other genetic conditions. Amniocentesis also can determine the sex of the fetus. | No
4860 | NarrativeText | Women who have a history of recurring miscar- riages may not want to have this procedure. | No
4861 | NarrativeText | Amniocentesis is usually performed in a doctor’s office on an outpatient basis. | No
4862 | Title | 220 | No
4863 | NarrativeText | Common side effects include cramping and bleeding. | No
4864 | NarrativeText | In about one out of every 1,000 cases, amniocentesis causes a needle to puncture the uterine wall, which could result in miscarriage. | No
4865 | NarrativeText | In most cases, couples find out their baby does not have a birth defect. | No
4866 | NarrativeText | If the results come back positive for Down’s Syn- drome or other serious conditions, the couple must decide if they want to end the pregnancy. Others use the knowledge to plan and prepare any special care needed for their future child. | No
4867 | Title | Group B Strep | No
4868 | NarrativeText | This test is for Group B streptococci (GBS) infection. | No
4869 | NarrativeText | By testing for GBS, physicians can determine if a woman is at risk of passing this infection along to her child. | No
4870 | NarrativeText | Women who have had a prior child with GBS, or who have a fever or prolonged or premature rupture of the amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type of infection. | No
4871 | NarrativeText | GBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in the vagina and rectum. Unlike regular strep throat, GBS can be present in a person’s body without causing any symptoms, so many women do not realize they are infected with it. | No
4872 | NarrativeText | To test for the presence of GBS, doctors may take a urine sample. They also may collect samples from the vagina or rectum, which are then analyzed in a lab. This test is usually performed late in pregnancy, at 35-37 weeks of gestation. | No
4873 | NarrativeText | This is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with no side effects. | No
4874 | NarrativeText | In many cases, doctors do not find any evidence of this type of infection. | No
4875 | NarrativeText | If a woman is found to be infected with Group B strep, physicians usually wait to treat it until just before labor begins. At that time, they may give the mother antibiotics so the baby is not born with the infection. Newborns who are exposed to Group B strep can have inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, blood or lungs. In some cases, this serious complication can result in infant death. | No

4892 | NarrativeText | Antepartum testing consists of a variety of tests per- formed late in pregnancy to verify fetal well-being, as judged by the baby’s heart rate and other characteristics. Antepartum tests include the nonstress test (NST), bio- physical profile, and contraction stress test (CST). | No
4893 | Title | Purpose | No
4894 | NarrativeText | Antepartum testing is performed after 32 weeks of pregnancy so that the couple and the doctor can be warned of any problems that may necessitate further test- ing or immediate delivery. The results reflect the adequa- cy of blood flow (and oxygen delivery) to the fetus from the placenta. | No
4895 | NarrativeText | Antepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies at high risk for fetal complications. Various reasons include: * any chronic illness in the mother, such as high blood pressure or diabetes * problems with previous pregnancies, such as stillbirth | No
4896 | ListItem | + fetal complications, such as intrauterine growth retar- dation (a slowing of growth of the fetus) or birth defects «problems in the current pregnancy, including pre- eclampsia (serious pregnancy-induced high blood pres- sure), gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, prema- ture rupture of the membranes, excessive amniotic fluid (the liquid that surrounds the fetus), vaginal bleeding, or placenta previa (a condition in which the placenta is positioned over the cervix instead of near the top of the uterus) | No
4897 | ListItem | * twins or other multiple fetuses One of the most common indications for antepartum testing is post-term pregnancy. A pregnancy should not be allowed to continue past 42 weeks. (The usual preg- nancy is 40 weeks in duration). Babies should be moni- tored with antepartum testing starting at 41 weeks. After 41 weeks, there is an increasing risk that the placenta cannot meet the growing baby’s needs for oxygen and nutrition. This may be reflected in decreased move- ments of the baby, decreased amniotic fluid, and changes in the heart rate pattern of the baby. | No
4898 | Title | Description | No
4899 | Title | Technology | No
4900 | NarrativeText | The NST and CST use a technique called electronic fetal monitoring to evaluate the heartbeat of the fetus. The biophysical profile is an ultrasound examination. | No
4901 | Title | NST | No
4902 | NarrativeText | The NST is usually the first antepartum test used to verify fetal well-being. It is based on the principle that when the fetus moves, its heartbeat normally speeds up. The NST assesses fetal health through monitoring accel- erations of the heart rate in response to the baby’s own movements, i.e., in the absence of stress. | No
4903 | NarrativeText | The mother lays down or sits, and an electronic fetal monitor is placed on her abdomen to monitor the fetal heart rate. The doctor records the baby’s heartbeat on a graph or “tracing” to determine whether it demonstrates | No
4904 | Title | 221 | No
4905 | NarrativeText | correct reactivity, or acceleration of the heart rate. To record fetal movements on the tracing, the mother press- es a button every time she feels the baby move. If the baby is inactive, the mother may be asked to rub her abdomen to “awaken” it. Sometimes an instrument is used to produce a loud noise to arouse the fetus (vibroa- coustic stimulation). The test usually takes between 20-45 minutes. | No
4906 | NarrativeText | A baby who is receiving enough oxygen should move at least twice in a 20 minute period. The baby’s heart rate should increase at least 20 beats per minute for at least 20 seconds during these movements. The NST is the simplest and cheapest antepartum test. | No
4907 | Title | Biophysical profile | No
4908 | NarrativeText | The biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam that can add additional information to the NST. During the biophysical profile, the examiner checks for various characteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall health. These include: fetal movement, fetal tone, breathing movements, and the amniotic fluid volume. Amniotic fluid volume is important because a decreased amount raises the possibility that the baby may be under stress. The five components of the test (NST is also included) are each given a score of 2 for normal (or present), | if decreased, and 0 for abnormal. The highest possible score is 10. The “modified” biophysical profile is another option; this includes only the NST and amniotic fluid volume. | No
4909 | Title | CST | No
4910 | NarrativeText | The CST is like the NST, except that the fetus is evaluated in response to contractions of the mother’s uterus. Because it is a more complicated test, it is often used after an abnormal NST to confirm the results. Uter- ine contractions produce “stress” in the fetus because they temporarily stop the flow of blood and oxygen. The CST is used to confirm that the fetus does not respond to this stress by a decrease in the heart rate. | No
4911 | NarrativeText | The CST is performed with the same equipment as the NST. Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate are recorded along with the onset, relative intensity, and duration of any spontaneous contractions. For an accu- rate test, the contractions should be of sufficient duration and frequency. If uterine activity does not occur natural- ly, a drug called oxytocin may be given to the mother intravenously (hence the test’s alternate name, the oxy- tocin challenge test) to provoke contractions. Another option is self-stimulation of the mother’s nipples, because this releases natural oxytocin. The fetal heart rate is observed until, ideally, three moderate contrac- tions occur within 10 minutes. | No
4912 | Title | 222 | No
4913 | Title | Preparation | No
4914 | NarrativeText | The mother should eat just before the antepartum tests to help stimulate fetal activity. | No
4915 | Title | Risks | No
4916 | NarrativeText | There are no appreciable risks from the NST or the biophysical profile. Ultrasound used for the biophysical profile is painless and safe because it uses no harmful radiation, and no evidence has been found that sound waves cause any adverse effects on the mother or fetus. | No
4917 | NarrativeText | The frequency of antepartum testing depends on the reason for its use. All of the tests occasionally give incor- rect results, which may prompt an unnecessary early delivery or cesarean. Repeat testing is important to dou- ble-check any abnormal findings. | No
4918 | Title | Normal results | No
4919 | NarrativeText | In general, “negative” or normal results on antepar- tum testing provide reassurance that the baby is healthy and should remain so for perhaps a week, with no need for immediate delivery. Unfortunately, the tests cannot guarantee that there are no problems, because falsely normal results can occur, though this is unusual. Even if all test results are normal, it is important to realize that this does not guarantee a “perfect” baby. | No
4920 | NarrativeText | The NST is normal (“reactive”) if two or more dis- tinct fetal movements occur in association with appropri- ate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within 20 minutes. A biophysical profile score of 8-10 is considered reassur- ing. The CST is normal if the fetus shows no decelera- tions in heart rate in response to three uterine contrac- tions within 10 minutes. | No
4921 | Title | Abnormal results | No
4922 | NarrativeText | A “positive” result suggests that the baby is not receiving enough oxygen for some reason. However, it is quite possible that the test result was falsely abnormal. To confirm or monitor a suspected disorder, follow-up testing with the same or an alternate test will probably be performed at least weekly. | No
4923 | NarrativeText | The NST is abnormal (“nonreactive”) if the fetal heart rate fails to speed up by at least 20 beats per minute at least two times during a 20-minute period. Abnormal decreases in the heart rate (decelerations) are also a cause for concern. | No
4924 | NarrativeText | A biophysical profile score of 6 is considered a cause for concern and should be followed by further test- ing. Scores of 4 or less may require immediate delivery of the fetus. | No
4925 | Title | KEY TERMS | No
4926 | NarrativeText | Amniotic fluid—The liquid that surrounds the baby within the amniotic sac. Because it is com- posed mostly of fetal urine, a low amount of fluid can indicate inadequate placental blood flow to the fetus. | No
4927 | NarrativeText | Deceleration—A decrease in the fetal heart rate that can indicate inadequate blood flow through the placenta. | No
4928 | NarrativeText | Oxytocin—A natural hormone that produces uter- ine contractions. | No
4929 | NarrativeText | Ultrasound—A procedure in which high-frequen- cy sound waves are used to create a picture of the baby, used alone or with antepartum tests. | No
4930 | NarrativeText | Vibroacoustic stimulation—In the biophysical profile, use of an artificial larynx to produce a loud noise to “awaken” the fetus. | No
4931 | NarrativeText | Abnormal results on the CST include late decelera- tions, or abnormal slowing of the fetal heart rate after the uterine contractions. This can suggest that the baby is not receiving enough oxygen and may have difficulty with- standing the stress of labor and vaginal delivery. Cesare- an section might be necessary so the baby can be spared the stress of labor. With either NST or CST, a severe deceleration (a period of very slow heartbeat) can also suggest fetal distress. | No
4932 | NarrativeText | The ultimate outcome will depend on the woman’s individual situation. In some cases, delivery can be post- poned while medication is given to the mother (e.g., for high blood pressure) or the fetus (e.g., to speed up lung maturity before delivery). Depending upon the readiness of the mother’s cervix, the doctor may decide to induce labor. The extra-large fetus of a diabetic woman may require cesarean delivery; severe preeclampsia also may necessitate induction of labor or cesarean section. The doctor will determine the most prudent course of action. | No

4948 | NarrativeText | Anthrax is a bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracis that primarily affects livestock but that can occasionally spread to humans, affecting either the skin, intestines, or lungs. In humans, the infection can often be treated, but it is almost always fatal in animals. | No
4949 | Title | Description | No
4950 | NarrativeText | Anthrax is most often found in the agricultural areas of South and Central America, southern and east- ern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. In the United States, anthrax is rarely reported, however, cases of animal infection with anthrax are most often reported in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. The bacterium and its associated disease get their name from the Greek word meaning “coal” because of the characteristic coal-black sore that is the hallmark of the most common form of the disease. | No
4951 | NarrativeText | During the 1800s, in England and Germany, anthrax was known either as ““wool-sorter’s” or “ragpicker’s” dis- ease because workers contracted the disease from bacter- ial spores present on hides and in wool or fabric fibers. Spores are the small, thick-walled dormant stage of some bacteria that enable them to survive for long periods of time under adverse conditions. The first anthrax vaccine was perfected in 1881 by Louis Pasteur. | No
4952 | NarrativeText | Humans suffering from anthrax often develop ulcerating nodules on the body. Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro- duced by permission.) | No
4953 | NarrativeText | The largest outbreak ever recorded in the United States occurred in 1957 when nine employees of a goat hair processing plant became ill after handling a contam- inated shipment from Pakistan. Four of the five patients with the pulmonary form of the disease died. Other cases appeared in the 1970s when contaminated goatskin drumheads from Haiti were brought into this country as souvenirs. Today, anthrax is rare, even among cattle, largely because of widespread animal vaccination. How- ever, some serious epidemics continue to occur among animal herds and in human settlements in developing countries due to ineffective control programs. | No
4954 | NarrativeText | There has been a great deal of recent concern that the bacteria that causes anthrax may be used by some countries as a type of biological warfare, since it is possi- ble to become infected simply by breathing in the spores. The largest-ever documented outbreak of human anthrax contracted through spore inhalation occurred in Russia in 1979, when anthrax spores were released from a military laboratory, causing a regional epidemic that killed 69 of its 77 victims. Because the United States government considers anthrax to be of potential risk to soldiers, the Department of Defense has begun systematic vaccination of all military personnel against anthrax, and other nations, such as Britain, are rapidly following suit. | No
4955 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
4956 | NarrativeText | Anthrax is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which produces spores that can remain dor- mant for years in soil and on animal products, such as hides, wool, hair, or bones. The disease is often fatal to cattle, sheep, and goats, and their hides, wool, and bones are often heavily contaminated. | No
4957 | NarrativeText | Today, in humans, the disease is almost always an occupational hazard, contracted by those who handle | No
4958 | Title | 224 | No
4959 | NarrativeText | animal hides (farmers, butchers, and veterinarians) or sort wool. It is also possible to become infected with anthrax by eating meat from contaminated animals. There are no reports of the disease spreading from one person to another. | No
4960 | NarrativeText | Symptoms vary depending on how the disease was contracted, but the symptoms usually appear within one week of exposure. | No
4961 | Title | Cutaneous anthrax | No
4962 | NarrativeText | In humans, anthrax usually occurs when the bacteria enter a cut or abrasion, causing a skin (cutaneous) infec- tion at the site. Cutaneous anthrax, as this infection is called, is the mildest form of the disease. At first, the bacteria cause an itchy, raised area like an insect bite. Within one to two days, inflammation occurs around the raised area, and a blister forms around an area of dying tissue that becomes black in the center. Other symptoms may include shivering and chills. In most cases the bacte- ria remain within the sore. If, however, they spread to the nearest lymph node (or, in rare cases, escape into the bloodstream), the bacteria can cause a form of blood poi- soning that rapidly proves fatal. | No
4963 | Title | nhalation anthrax | No
4964 | NarrativeText | Inhaling the bacteria or bacterial spores can lead to a rare, fatal form of anthrax known as pulmonary or inhalation anthrax that attacks the lungs and sometimes spreads to the brain. Inhalation anthrax begins with flu- like symptoms, namely fever, fatigue, headache, and shortness of breath, but progresses to bronchitis, dur- ing which time it becomes difficult to breathe, and final- ly, the patient enters a state of shock. This rare form of anthrax is usually fatal, even if treated within one or two days after the symptoms appear. | No
4965 | Title | ntestinal anthrax | No
4966 | NarrativeText | Intestinal anthrax is a rare, often-fatal form of the dis- ease, caused by eating meat from an animal that died of anthrax. Intestinal anthrax causes stomach and intestinal inflammation and sores or lesions (ulcers), much like the sores that appear on the skin in the cutaneous form of anthrax. The first signs of the disease are nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and fever, followed by abdomi- nal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe bloody diarrhea. | No
4967 | Title | Diagnosis | No
4968 | NarrativeText | Anthrax is diagnosed by detecting B. anthracis in samples taken from blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions. The bacteria may be positively identified using biochemical methods or using a technique where- by, if present in the sample, the anthrax bacterium is made to fluoresce. Blood samples will also indicate ele- vated antibody levels or increased amounts of a protein produced directly in response to infection with the anthrax bacterium. Additional DNA-based tests are also currently being perfected. | No
4969 | Title | Treatment | No
4970 | NarrativeText | In the early stages, anthrax is curable by administering high doses of penicillin, but in the advanced stages, it can be fatal. Other commonly used antibiotics, such as ery- thromycin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol, are also effec- tive, particularly for those individuals who are allergic to penicillin. Although not proven, it is thought that newer antibiotics, like ciprofloxacin and some cephalosporins, may also prove effective. Although cutaneous anthrax may be cured following a single dose of antibiotic, it is impor- tant to continue treatment so as to avoid potential serious complications, such as inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). | No
4971 | Title | Prognosis | No
4972 | NarrativeText | Untreated anthrax is often fatal, but death is far less likely with appropriate care. Ten to twenty percent of patients will die from anthrax of the skin (cutaneous anthrax) if it is not properly treated. All patients with inhalation (pulmonary) anthrax will die if untreated. Intestinal anthrax is fatal 25-75% of the time. | No
4973 | Title | Prevention | No
4974 | NarrativeText | Anthrax is relatively rare in the United States because of widespread animal vaccination and practices used to disinfect hides or other animal products. For those in high-risk professions, an anthrax vaccine is available that is 93% effective in protecting against infec- tion. To provide this immunity, an individual must be given an initial course of three injections, given two weeks apart, followed by booster injections at 6, 12, and 18 months and an annual immunization thereafter. | No
4975 | NarrativeText | Approximately 30% of those who have been vacci- nated against anthrax may notice mild local reactions, such as a slight tenderness at the injection site. Someone who has already had anthrax might have a more severe local reaction upon vaccination. Infrequently, there may be a severe local reaction with extensive swelling of the forearm, and only a very few vaccine recipients may have a more general flu-like reaction to the shot. | No

5003 | NarrativeText | Antiacne drugs are medicines that help clear up pim- ples, blackheads, whiteheads, and more severe forms of acne. | No
5004 | Title | Purpose | No
5005 | NarrativeText | Different types of antiacne drugs are used for differ- ent purposes. For example, lotions, soaps, gels, and creams containing benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin may be used to clear up mild to moderately severe acne. Isotretinoin (Accutane) is prescribed only for very severe, disfiguring acne. | No
5006 | NarrativeText | Acne is a skin condition that occurs when pores or hair follicles become blocked. This allows a waxy material, sebum, to collect inside the pores or follicles. Normally, sebum flows out onto the skin and hair to form a protective coating, but when it cannot get out, small swellings develop on the skin surface. Bacteria and dead skin cells can also collect that can cause inflammation. Swellings that are small and not inflamed are whiteheads or blackheads. When they become inflamed, they turn into pimples. Pimples that fill with pus are called pustules. | No
5007 | NarrativeText | Acne cannot be cured, but acne drugs can help clear the skin. Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin work by mildly irritating the skin. This encourages skin cells to slough off, which helps open blocked pores. Benzoyl! peroxide also kills bacteria, which helps prevent whiteheads and blackheads from turning into pimples. Isotretinoin shrinks the glands that produce sebum. | No

5010 | NarrativeText | Benzoyl peroxide is found in many over-the-counter acne products that are applied to the skin, such as Benoxyl, Clear By Design, Neutrogena Acne, PanOxyl, and some formulations of Clean & Clear, Clearasil, and Oxy. Some benzoy] peroxide products are available with- out a physician’s prescription; others require a prescrip- tion. Tretinoin (Retin-A) is available only with a physi- cian’s prescription and comes in liquid, cream, and gel forms, which are applied to the skin. Isotretinoin (Accu- tane), which is taken by mouth in capsule form, is avail- able only with a physician’s prescription. Only physicians who have experience in diagnosing and treating severe acne, such as dermatologists, should prescribe isotretinoin. | No
5011 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
5012 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of anti-acne drug. These drugs usually come with written directions for patients and should be used only as direct- ed. Patients who have questions about how to use the medicine should check with a physician or pharmacist. | No
5013 | NarrativeText | Patients who use isotretinoin usually take the medi- cine for a few months, then stop for at least two months. Their acne may continue to improve even after they stop taking the medicine. If the condition is still severe after several months of treatment and a two-month break, the physician may prescribe a second course of treatment. | No

5016 | NarrativeText | Isotretinoin can cause serious birth defects, includ- ing mental retardation and physical deformities. This medicine should not be used during pregnancy. Women who are able to bear children should not use isotretinoin unless they have very severe acne that has not cleared up with the use of other anti-acne drugs. In that case, a woman who uses this drug must have a pregnancy test two weeks before beginning treatment and each month they are taking the drug. Another pregnancy test must be done one month after treatment ends. The woman must use an effective birth control method for one month before treatment begins and must continue using it throughout treatment and for one month after treatment ends. Women who are able to bear children and who want to use this medicine should discuss this information with their health care providers. Before using the medicine, they will be asked to sign a consent form stating that they understand the danger of taking isotretinoin during preg- nancy and that they agree to use effective birth control. | No

5020 | NarrativeText | Isotretinoin may cause a sudden decrease in night vision. If this happens, do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until vision returns to normal. Let the physician know about the problem. | No
5021 | NarrativeText | If benzoyl! peroxide or tretinoin make the skin too red or too dry or cause too much peeling, check with a physician. Using the medicine less often or using a weaker strength may be necessary. | No
5022 | NarrativeText | This medicine may also make the eyes, nose, and mouth dry. Ask the physician about using special eye drops to relieve eye dryness. To temporarily relieve the dry mouth, chew sugarless gum, suck on sugarless candy or ice chips, or use saliva substitutes, which come in liquid and tablet forms and are available without a pre- scription. If the problem continues for more than two weeks, check with a physician or dentist. Mouth dryness that continues over a long time may contribute to tooth decay and other dental problems. | No
5023 | NarrativeText | Tretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight. While being treated with this medicine, avoid exposure to the sun and do not use tanning beds, tanning booths, or sunlamps. If it is not possible to avoid being in the sun, use a sun- screen with a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 or wear protective clothing over the treated areas. The skin may also become more sensitive to cold and wind. People who use this medicine should protect their skin from cold and wind until they know how the medicine affects them. | No

5029 | NarrativeText | People who have certain medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines may have problems if they use antiacne drugs. Before using these products, be sure to let the physician know about any of these conditions: ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to etretinate, isotretinoin, tretinoin, vitamin A prepara- tions, or benzoyl peroxide in the past should let his or her physician know before using an antiacne drug. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
5030 | NarrativeText | When applying antiacne drugs to the skin, be careful not to get the medicine in the eyes, mouth, or inside of the nose. Do not put the medicine on skin that is wind burned, sunburned, or irritated, and do not apply it to open wounds. | No
5031 | NarrativeText | PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should check with a physician before using tretinoin or benzoy! peroxide. /sotretinoin causes birth defects in humans and must not be used during pregnancy. | No
5032 | NarrativeText | Because antiacne drugs such as benzoyl! peroxide and tretinoin irritate the skin slightly, avoid doing any- thing that might cause further irritation. Wash the face with mild soap and water only two or three times a day, unless the physician says to wash it more often. Avoid using abrasive soaps or cleansers and products that might BREASTFEEDING. No problems have been reported in nursing babies whose mothers used tretinoin or ben- zoyl peroxide. Women who are breastfeeding babies should not take isotretinoin, however, as it may cause problems in nursing babies. | No
5033 | NarrativeText | OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti- acne drugs applied to the skin, people with any of these medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of their conditions: * eczema. Anti-acne drugs that are applied to the skin may make this condition worse. | No
5034 | ListItem | * sunburn or raw skin. Anti-acne drugs that are applied to the skin may increase the pain and irritation of these conditions. | No
5035 | NarrativeText | In people with certain medical conditions, isotre- tinoin may increase the amount of triglyceride (a fatty- substance) in the blood. This may lead to heart or blood vessel problems. Before using isotretinoin, people with any of these medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of their conditions: ¢ alcoholism or heavy drinking, now or in the past ¢ diabetes (or family history of diabetes). Isotretinoin may also change blood sugar levels. | No

5081 | Title | Purpose | No
5082 | NarrativeText | The dull, tight chest pain of angina occurs when the heart’s muscular wall is not getting enough oxygen. By relaxing the blood vessels, antiangina drugs reduce the heart’s work load and increase the amount of oxygen- rich blood that reaches the heart. These drugs come in different forms, and are used in three main ways: *taken regularly over a long period, they reduce the number of angina attacks. | No
5083 | ListItem | + taken just before some activity that usually brings on an attack, such as climbing stairs, they prevent attacks. | No
5084 | ListItem | * taken when an attack begins, they relieve the pain and pressure. | No
5085 | NarrativeText | Not every form of antiangina drug can be used in every way. Some work too slowly to prevent attacks that are about to begin or to relieve attacks that have already started. These forms can be used only to reduce the num- ber of attacks. Be sure to understand how and when to use the type of antiangina drug that has been prescribed. | No
5086 | Title | Description | No
5087 | NarrativeText | Antiangina drugs, also known as nitrates, come in many different forms: tablets and capsules that are swal- lowed; tablets that are held under the tongue, inside the lip, or in the cheek until they dissolve; stick-on patches; ointment; and in-the-mouth sprays. Commonly used antiangina drugs include isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil, Sorbitrate, and other brands) and nitroglycerin (Nitro- Bid, Nitro-Dur, Nitrolingual Spray, Nitrostat Tablets, Transderm-Nitro, and other brands). These medicines are available only with a physician’s prescription. | No

5094 | NarrativeText | Remember that some forms of antiangina drugs work too slowly to relieve attacks that have already start- ed. Check with the physician who prescribed the medi- cine for instructions on how to use the type that has been prescribed. Patients who are using slower-acting forms to make attacks less frequent may want to ask their physi- cians to prescribe a fast-acting type to relieve attacks. Another method of treating the frequency of attacks is to increase the dosage of the long-acting antiangina drug. Do this only with the approval of a physician. | No
5095 | NarrativeText | Anyone who has had unusual reactions to antiangina drugs in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No

5097 | NarrativeText | Older people may be especially sensitive to the effects of antiangina drugs and thus more likely to have side effects such as dizziness and lightheadedness. | No
5098 | NarrativeText | These medicines make some people feel lighthead- ed, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lying down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and hold onto something for support if possible. Antiangina drugs may also cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting in hot weather or when people stand for a long time or exercise. Use caution in all these situations. Drinking alcohol while taking antiangina drugs may cause the same problems. Anyone who takes this medicine should limit the amount of alcohol consumed. | No

5118 | NarrativeText | Antianxiety drugs are medicines that calm and relax people with excessive anxiety, nervousness, or tension, or for short term control of social phobia disorder or spe- cific phobia disorder. | No
5119 | Title | Purpose | No
5120 | NarrativeText | Antianxiety agents, or anxiolytics, may be used to treat mild transient bouts of anxiety as well as more pro- nounced episodes of social phobia and specific phobia. Clinically significant anxiety is marked by several symptoms. The patient experiences marked or persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which he or she is exposed to unfamiliar people or pos- sible scrutiny by others, and may react in a humiliating or embarrassing way. The exposure to the feared situa- tion produces an anxiety attack. Fear of these episodes of anxiety leads to avoidance behavior, which impairs normal social functioning, including working or attend- ing classes. The patient is aware that these fears are unjustified. | No
5121 | Title | Description | No
5122 | NarrativeText | In psychiatric practice, treatment of anxiety has largely turned from traditional antianxiety agents, anxi- olytics, to antidepressant therapies. In current use, the benzodiazepines, the best known class of anxiolytics, have been largely supplanted by serotonin-specific reup- take inhibitors (SSRIs, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxam- ine and others) which have a milder side effect profile and less risk of dependency. However, traditional anxi- olytics remain useful for patients who need a rapid onset of action, or whose frequency of exposure to anxiety pro- voking stimuli is low enough to eliminate the need for continued treatment. While SSRIs may require three to five weeks to show any effects, and must be taken contin- uously, benzodiazepines may produce a response within 30 minutes, and may be dosed on an as-needed basis. | No
5123 | NarrativeText | The intermediate action benzodiazepines, alprazo- lam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan) are the appropriate choice for treatment of mild anxiety and social phobia. Diazepam (Valium) is still widely used for anxiety, but its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which has a long half-life, may make this a poorer choice than other drugs in its class. Note that there is considerable varia- tion between individuals in metabolism of benzodi- azepines, so patient response may not be predictable. As a class, benzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolytics, but also as sedatives, muscle relaxants, and in treatment of epilepsy and alcoholism. The distinctions between these uses are largely determined by onset and duration of action, and route of administration. | No
5124 | NarrativeText | Buspirone (BuSpar), which is not chemically related to other classes of central nervous system drugs, is also a traditional anxiolytic, although it is now considered either a third line or adjunctive agent for use after trials of SSRIs and benzodiazepines. It is appropriate for use in patients who have either failed trials of other treatments, or who should not receive benzodiazepines because of a history of substance abuse problems. Buspirone, in com- mon with antidepressants, requires a two to three week period before there is clinical evidence of improvement, and must be continuously dosed to maintain its effects. | No

5128 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
5129 | NarrativeText | Benzodiazepines should be administered 30 to 60 minutes before exposure to the anticipated stress. Dosage should be individualized to minimize sedation. The normal dose of alprazolam is 0.25—-0.5 mg. The usual dose of lorazepam is 2-3 mg. Doses may be repeat- ed if necessary. | No
5130 | NarrativeText | Buspirone is initially dosed at 5 mg t.i.d. (3 times a day.) Increase the dosage 5 mg/day, at intervals of two to three days, as needed. Do not exceed 60 mg/day. Two to three weeks may be required before a satisfactory response is seen. | No
5131 | Title | Precautions | No
5132 | NarrativeText | Benzodiazepines should not be used in patients with psychosis, acute narrow angle glaucoma, or liver dis- ease. The drugs can act as respiratory depressants and should be avoided in patients with respiratory conditions. Benzodiazepines are potentially addictive and should not be administered to patients with substance abuse disor- ders. Because benzodiazepines are sedative, they should be avoided in patients who must remain alert. Their use for periods over four months has not been documented. These drugs should not be used during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, although use during the first trimester appears to be safe. They should not be taken while breastfeeding. Consult specialized references for use in children. | No

5153 | NarrativeText | Antiarrhythmic drugs are medicines that correct irreg- ular heartbeats and slow down hearts that beat too fast. | No
5154 | Title | Purpose | No
5155 | NarrativeText | Normally, the heart beats at a steady, even pace. The pace is controlled by electrical signals that begin in one part of the heart and quickly spread through the whole heart. If something goes wrong with this control system, the result may be an irregular heartbeat, or an arrhythmia. Antiar- rhythmic drugs correct irregular heartbeats, restoring the normal rhythm. If the heart is beating too fast, these drugs will slow it down. By correcting these problems, antiar- rhythmic drugs help the heart work more efficiently. | No
5156 | Title | Description | No
5157 | NarrativeText | Antiarrhythmic drugs are available only with a physician’s prescription and are sold in capsule (regular and extended release), tablet (regular and extended- release), and injectable forms. Commonly used antiar- rhythmic drugs are disopyramide (Norpace, Norpace CR), procainamide (Procan SR, Pronestyl, Pronestyl- SR), and quinidine (Cardioquin, Duraquin, Quinidex, and other brands). Do not confuse quinidine with qui- nine, which is a related medicine with different uses, such as relieving leg cramps. | No
5158 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
5159 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of antiarrhythmic drug and other factors. Doses may be dif- ferent for different patients. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage. | No

5238 | NarrativeText | Antiasthmatic drugs are medicines that treat or pre- vent asthma attacks. | No
5239 | Title | Purpose | No
5240 | NarrativeText | For people with asthma, the simple act of breathing can be a struggle. Their airways become inflamed and blocked with mucus during asthma attacks, narrowing the opening through which air passes. This is not such a prob- lem when the person breathes in, because the airways nat- urally expand when a person takes a breath. The real prob- lem arises when the person with asthma tries to breathe out. The air cannot get out through the blocked airways, so it stays trapped in the lungs. With each new breath, the person can take in only a little more air, so breathing becomes shallow and takes more and more effort. | No
5241 | NarrativeText | Asthma attacks can be caused by allergies to pollen, dust, pets or other things, but people without known allergies may also have asthma. Exercise, stress, intense emotions, exposure to cold, certain medicines and some medical conditions also can bring on attacks. | No
5242 | NarrativeText | The two main approaches to dealing with asthma are avoiding substances and situations that trigger attacks and using medicines that treat or prevent the symptoms. With a combination of the two, most people with asthma can find relief and live normal lives. | No

This makes the airways open wider, letting more air pass through them. These drugs are used main- ly to relieve sudden asthma attacks or to prevent attacks that might come on after exercise. They may be taken by mouth, injected or inhaled. | No
5245 | ListItem | Corticosteroids block the inflammation that narrows the airways. Used regularly, these drugs will help pre- vent asthma attacks. Those attacks that do occur will be less severe. However, corticosteroids cannot stop an attack that is already underway. These drugs may be taken by mouth, injected or inhaled. | No
5246 | ListItem | Cromolyn also is taken regularly to prevent asthma attacks and may be used alone or with other asthma medicines. It cannot stop an attack that already has started. The drug works by preventing certain cells in the body from releasing substances that cause allergic reactions or asthma symptoms. One brand of this drug, Nasalcrom, comes in capsule and nasal spray forms and is used to treat hay fever and other aller- gies. The inhalation form of the drug, Intal, is used for asthma. It comes in aerosol canisters, in capsules that are inserted into an inhaler, and in liquid form that is used in a nebulizer. | No

5248 | NarrativeText | Patients who are using their antiasthmatic drugs cor- rectly but feel their asthma is not under control should see their physicians. The physician can either increase the dose, switch to another medicine or add another med- icine to the regimen. | No
5249 | NarrativeText | Corticosteroids are powerful drugs that may cause serious side effects when used over a long time. However, these problems are much less likely with the inhalant forms than with the oral and injected forms. While the oral and injected forms generally should be used only for one to two weeks, the inhalant forms may be used for long periods. | No
5250 | NarrativeText | When used to prevent asthma attacks, cromolyn must be taken as directed every day. The drug may take as long as four weeks to start working. Unless told to do so by a physician, patients should not stop taking the drug just because it does not seem to be working. When symptoms do begin to improve, patients should continue taking all medicines that have been prescribed, unless a physician directs otherwise. | No
5251 | Title | Side effects | No
5252 | Title | Precautions | No
5253 | NarrativeText | Using antiasthmatic drugs properly is important. Because bronchodilators provide quick relief, some peo- ple may be tempted to overuse them. However, with some kinds of bronchodilators, this can lead to serious and possibly life-threatening complications. In the long run, patients are better off using bronchodilators only as Inhalant forms of antiasthmatic drugs may cause dryness or irritation in the throat, dry mouth, or an unpleasant taste in the mouth. To help prevent these problems, gargle and rinse the mouth or take a sip of water after each dose. | No

5268 | NarrativeText | Antibiotic-associated colitis is an inflammation of the intestines that sometimes occurs following antibiotic treatment and is caused by toxins produced by the bac- terium Clostridium difficile. | No
5269 | Title | Description | No
5270 | NarrativeText | Antibiotic-associated colitis, also called antibiotic- associated enterocolitis, can occur following antibiotic treatment. The bacteria Clostridia difficile are normally found in the intestines of 5% of healthy adults, but peo- ple can also pick up the bacteria while they are in a hos- pital or nursing home. In a healthy person, harmless resi- dent intestinal bacteria compete with each other for food and places to “sit” along the inner intestinal wall. When antibiotics are given, most of the resident bacteria are | No
5271 | Title | 238 | No
5272 | NarrativeText | killed. With fewer bacteria to compete with, the normally harmless Clostridia difficile grow rapidly and produce toxins. These toxins damage the inner wall of the intestines and cause inflammation and diarrhea. | No
5273 | NarrativeText | Although all antibiotics can cause this disease, it is most commonly caused by clindamycin (Cleocin), ampi- cillin (Omnipen), amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, or Wymox), and any in the cephalosporin class (such as cefazolin or cephalexin). Symptoms of the condition can occur during antibiotic treatment or within four weeks after the treatment has stopped. | No
5274 | NarrativeText | In approximately half of cases of antibiotic-associated colitis, the condition progresses to a more severe form of colitis called pseudomembranous enterocolitis in which pseudomembranes are excreted in the stools. Pseudomem- branes are membrane-like collections of white blood cells, mucus, and the protein that causes blood to clot (fibrin) that are released by the damaged intestinal wall. | No
5275 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
5276 | NarrativeText | Antibiotic-associated colitis is caused by toxins pro- duced by the bacterium Clostridium difficile after treat- ment with antibiotics. When most of the other intestinal bacteria have been killed, Clostridium difficile grows rapidly and releases toxins that damage the intestinal wall. The disease and symptoms are caused by these tox- ins, not by the bacterium itself. | No
5277 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of antibiotic-associated colitis usually begin four to ten days after antibiotic treatment has begun. The early signs and symptoms of this disease include lower abdominal cramps, an increased need to pass stool, and watery diarrhea. As the disease progress- es, the patient may experience a general ill feeling, fatigue, abdominal pain, and fever. If the disease pro- ceeds to pseudomembranous enterocolitis, the patient may also experience nausea, vomiting, large amounts of watery diarrhea, and a very high fever (104-105°F/40- 40.5°C). Complications of antibiotic-associated colitis include severe dehydration, imbalances in blood miner- als, low blood pressure, fluid accumulation in deep skin (edema), enlargement of the large intestine (toxic mega- colon), and the formation of a tear (perforation) in the wall of the large intestine. | No
5278 | NarrativeText | Clostridium difficile is easily spread from person to person in hospitals and nursing homes. The following individuals are most at-risk for developing this disease: « the elderly + severely ill individuals | No
5279 | ListItem | + individuals with weakened or suppressed immune sys- tems (immunocompromised) | No
5280 | ListItem | + individuals with poor hygiene + individuals who have been hospitalized for a long peri- od of time | No
5281 | NarrativeText | The Clostridium difficile toxin is found in the stools of persons older than 60 years of age 20-100 times more frequently than in the stools of persons who are 10-20 years old. As a result, the elderly are much more prone to developing antibiotic-associated colitis than younger individuals. | No
5282 | Title | Diagnosis | No
5283 | NarrativeText | Antibiotic-associated colitis can be diagnosed by the symptoms and recent medical history of the patient, by a laboratory test for the bacterial toxin, and/or by using a procedure called endoscopy. | No
5284 | NarrativeText | If the diarrhea and related symptoms occurred after the patient received antibiotics, antibiotic-associated col- itis may be suspected. A stool sample may be analyzed for the presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin. This toxin test is the preferred diagnostic test for antibiotic- associated colitis. One frequently used test for the toxin involves adding the processed stool sample to a human cell culture. If the toxin is present in the stool sample, the cells die. It may take up to two days to get the results from this test. A simpler test, which provides results in two to three hours, is also available. Symptoms and toxin test results are usually enough to diagnose the disease. | No
5285 | NarrativeText | Another tool that may be useful in the diagnosis of antibiotic-associated colitis, however, is a procedure called an endoscopy that involves inserting a thin, lighted tube into the rectum to visually inspect the intestinal lin- ing. Two different types of endoscopy procedures, the sigmoidoscopy and the colonoscopy, are used to view different parts of the large intestine. These procedures are performed in a hospital or doctor’s office. Patients are sedated during the procedure to make them more com- fortable and are allowed to go home after recovering from the sedation. | No
5286 | Title | Treatment | No
5287 | NarrativeText | Diarrhea, regardless of the cause, is always treated by encouraging the individual to replace lost fluids and prevent dehydration. One method to treat antibiotic-asso- ciated colitis is to simply stop taking the antibiotic that caused the disease. This allows the normal intestinal bac- teria to repopulate the intestines and inhibits the over- growth of Clostridium difficile. Many patients with mild disease respond well to this and are free from diarrhea within two weeks. It is important, however, to make sure that the original disease for which the antibiotics were prescribed is treated. | No

5295 | NarrativeText | Because of the potential seriousness of this disease, most patients are given another antibiotic to control the growth of the Clostridium difficile, usually vancomycin (Vancocin) or metronidazole (Flagyl or Protostat). Both are designed to be taken orally four times a day for 10-14 days. Upon finishing antibiotic treatment, approximately 15-20% of patients will experience a relapse of diarrhea within one to five weeks. Mild relapses can go untreated with great success, however, severe relapses of diarrhea require another round of antibiotic treatment. Instead of further antibiotic treatment, a cholestyramine resin (Questran or Prevalite) may be given. The bacterial tox- ins produced in the intestine stick to the resin and are passed out with the resin in the stool. Unfortunately, however, vancomycin also sticks to the resin, so these two drugs cannot be taken at the same time. Serious dis- ease may require hospitalization so that the patient can be monitored, treated, and rehydrated. | No
5296 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
5297 | NarrativeText | The goal of alternative treatment for antibiotic-asso- ciated enterocolitis is to repopulate the intestinal envi- ronment with microorganisms that are normal and healthy for the intestinal tract. These microorgansisms then compete for space and keep the Clostridium difficile from over-populating. | No

5321 | Title | Definition | No
5322 | NarrativeText | Antibiotics may be informally defined as the sub- group of anti-infectives that are derived from bacterial sources and are used to treat bacterial infections. Other classes of drugs, most notably the sulfonamides, may be effective antibacterials. Similarly, some antibiotics may have secondary uses, such as the use of demeclocycline (Declomycin, a tetracycline derivative) to treat the syn- drome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Other antibiotics may be useful in treating pro- tozoal infections. | No
5323 | Title | Purpose | No
5324 | NarrativeText | Antibiotics are used for treatment or prevention of bacterial infection. | No
5325 | Title | Description | No
5326 | NarrativeText | Classifications Although there are several classification schemes for antibiotics, based on bacterial spectrum (broad versus nar- row) or route of administration (injectable versus oral ver- sus topical), or type of activity (bactericidal vs. bacteriosta- tic), the most useful is based on chemical structure. Antibi- otics within a structural class will generally show similar patterns of effectiveness, toxicity, and allergic potential. | No
5327 | NarrativeText | PENICILLINS. The penicillins are the oldest class of antibiotics, and have a common chemical structure which they share with the cephalopsorins. The two groups are classed as the beta-lactam antibiotics, and are generally bacteriocidal—that is, they kill bacteria rather than inhibiting growth. The penicillins can be further subdi- vided. The natural pencillins are based on the original penicillin G structure; penicillinase-resistant penicillins, notably methicillin and oxacillin, are active even in the presence of the bacterial enzyme that inactivates most natural penicillins. Aminopenicillins such as ampicillin and amoxicillin have an extended spectrum of action compared with the natural penicillins; extended spectrum penicillins are effective against a wider range of bacteria. These generally include coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginaosa and may provide the penicillin in combina- tion with a penicillinase inhibitor. | No
5328 | NarrativeText | CEPHALOSPORINS. Cephalosporins and the closely related cephamycins and carbapenems, like the pen- cillins, contain a beta-lactam chemical structure. Conse- quently, there are patterns of cross-resistance and cross- allergenicity among the drugs in these classes. The “cepha” drugs are among the most diverse classes of antibiotics, and are themselves subgrouped into Ist, 2nd and 3rd generations. Each generation has a broader spec- trum of activity than the one before. In addition, cefox- itin, a cephamycin, is highly active against anaerobic bacteria, which offers utility in treatment of abdominal infections. The 3rd generation drugs, cefotaxime, cefti- zoxime, ceftriaxone and others, cross the blood-brain barrier and may be used to treat meningitis and encephalitis. Cephalopsorins are the usually preferred agents for surgical prophylaxis. | No
5329 | NarrativeText | FLUROQUINOLONES. The fluroquinolones are syn- thetic antibacterial agents, and not derived from bacteria. They are included here because they can be readily inter- changed with traditional antibiotics. An earlier, related class of antibacterial agents, the quinolones, were not well absorbed, and could be used only to treat urinary tract infections. The fluroquinolones, which are based on the older group, are broad-spectrum bacteriocidal drugs that are chemically unrelated to the penicillins or the cephaloprosins. They are well distributed into bone tis- sue, and so well absorbed that in general they are as effective by the oral route as by intravenous infusion. | No
5330 | NarrativeText | TETRACYCLINES. Tetracyclines got their name because they share a chemical structure that has four rings. They are derived from a species of Streptomyces bacteria. Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic agents, the tetracyclines may be effective against a wide variety of microorganisms, including rickettsia and amebic parasites. | No
5331 | NarrativeText | MACROLIDES. The macrolide antibiotics are derived from Streptomyces bacteria, and got their name because they all have a macrocyclic lactone chemical structure. Erythromycin, the prototype of this class, has a spectrum and use similar to penicillin. Newer members of the group, azithromycin and clarithyromycin, are particular- ly useful for their high level of lung penetration. Clar- ithromycin has been widely used to treat Helicobacter pylori infections, the cause of stomach ulcers. | No

5337 | NarrativeText | All antibiotics cause risk of overgrowth by non-sus- ceptible bacteria. Manufacturers list other major hazards by class; however, the health care provider should review each drug individually to assess the degree of risk. Gen- erally, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking antibiotics because of risk of alteration to infant’s intesti- nal flora, and risk of masking infection in the infant. Excessive or inappropriate use may promote growth of resistant pathogens. | No

5401 | NarrativeText | Topical antibiotics help prevent infections caused by bacteria that get into minor cuts, scrapes, and burns. Treating minor wounds with antibiotics allows quicker healing. If the wounds are left untreated, the bacteria will multiply, causing pain, redness, swelling, itching, and oozing. Untreated infections can eventually spread and become much more serious. | No

5403 | NarrativeText | When treating a wound, it is not enough to simply apply a topical antibiotic. The wound must first be cleaned with soap and water and patted dry. After the antibiotic is applied, the wound should be covered with a dressing, such as a bandage or a protective gel or spray. For many years, it was thought that wounds heal best when exposed to the air. But now most experts say it is best to keep wounds clean and moist while they heal. The covering should still allow some air to reach the wound, however. | No

5409 | Title | Precautions | No
5410 | NarrativeText | Many public health experts are concerned about antibiotic resistance, a problem that can develop when antibiotics are overused. Over time, bacteria develop new defenses against antibiotics that once were effective against them. Because bacteria reproduce so quickly, these defenses can be rapidly passed on through genera- tions of bacteria until almost all are immune to the effects of a particular antibiotic. The process happens faster than new antibiotics can be developed. To help control the problem, many experts advise people to use topical antibiotics only for short periods, that is, until the wound heals, and only as directed. For the topical antibi- otic to work best, it should be used only to prevent infec- tion in a fresh wound, not to treat an infection that has already started. Wounds that are not fresh may need the attention of a physician to prevent complications such as blood poisoning. | No

5448 | NarrativeText | Anticancer drugs are used to control the growth of cancerous cells. Cancer is commonly defined as the uncontrolled growth of cells, with loss of differentiation and commonly, with metastasis, spread of the cancer to other tissues and organs. Cancers are malignant growths. In contrast, benign growths remain encapsulated and grow within a well-defined area. Although benign tumors may be fatal if untreated, due to pressure on essential organs, as in the case of a benign brain tumor, surgery or radiation are the preferred methods of treating growths which have a well defined location.

As a result, antineoplastic drugs will commonly affect not only the cancerous cells, but others cells that com- monly reproduce quickly, including hair follicles, ovaries and testis, and the blood-forming organs. | No

Although these approaches hold promise, they are not yet in common use. | No
5457 | NarrativeText | Antineoplastic drugs may be divided into two class- es: cycle specific and non-cycle specific. Cycle specific drugs act only at specific points of the cell’s duplication cycle, such as anaphase or metaphase, while non-cycle specific drugs may act at any point in the cell cycle. In order to gain maximum effect, antineoplastic drugs are commonly used in combinations. | No
5458 | Title | Precautions | No
5459 | NarrativeText | Because antineoplastic agents do not target specific cell types, they have a number of common adverse side effects. Hair loss is common due to the effects on hair fol- licles, and anemia, immune system impairment, and clot- ting problems are caused by destruction of the blood form- ing organs, leading to reduction in the number of red cells, white cells, and platelets. Because of the frequency and severity of these side effects, it is common to administer chemotherapy in cycles, allowing time for recovery from the drug effects before administering the next dose.

Similarly, the patient should avoid contact with other people who have recently had live virus immunizations. | No
5465 | NarrativeText | The patient must also know which side effects should be reported to the practitioner, since many adverse effects do not appear until several days after a dose of chemotherapy. When chemotherapy is self- administered, the patient must be familiar with proper use of the drugs, including dose scheduling and avoid- ance of drug-drug and food-drug interactions. | No
5466 | NarrativeText | Appropriate steps should be taken to minimize side effects. These may include administration of antinause- ant medications to reduce nausea and vomiting, main- taining fluid levels to reduce drug toxicity, particularly to the kidneys, or application of a scalp tourniquet to reduce blood flow to the scalp and minimize hair loss due to drug therapy. | No
5467 | NarrativeText | Other precautions which should be emphasized are the risks to pregnant or nursing women. Because antineo- plastic drugs are commonly harmful to the fetus, women of childbearing potential should be cautioned to use two effective methods of birth control while receiving cancer chemotherapy. This also applies if the woman’s male partner is receiving chemotherapy. Breastfeeding should be avoided while the mother is being treated. | No
5468 | NarrativeText | Before prescribing or administering anticancer drugs, health care providers should inquire whether the patient has any of the following conditions: * chickenpox or recent exposure to someone with chick- enpox Patients receiving chemotherapy are also at risk of infections due to reduced white blood counts.

5513 | Title | Definition | No
5514 | NarrativeText | Anticoagulants are drugs used to prevent clot forma- tion or to prevent a clot that has formed from enlarging. They inhibit clot formation by blocking the action of clotting factors or platelets. Anticoagulant drugs fall into three categories: inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis, inhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs. | No
5515 | Title | Purpose | No
5516 | NarrativeText | Anticoagulant drugs reduce the ability of the blood to form clots. Although blood clotting is essential to pre- vent serious bleeding in the case of skin cuts, clots inside the blood vessels block the flow of blood to major organs and cause heart attacks and strokes. Although these drugs are sometimes called blood thinners, they do not actually thin the blood. Furthermore, this type of medication will not dissolve clots that already have formed, although the drug stops an existing clot from worsening. However, another type of drug, used in thrombolytic therapy, will dissolve existing clots. | No
5517 | NarrativeText | Anticoagulant drugs are used for a number of condi- tions. For example, they may be given to prevent blood clots from forming after the replacement of a heart valve or to reduce the risk of a stroke or another heart attack after a first heart attack. They are also used to reduce the chance of blood clots forming during open heart surgery or bypass surgery. Low doses of these drugs may be given to prevent blood clots in patients who must stay in bed for a long time after certain types of surgery. | No
5518 | NarrativeText | Because anticoagulants affect the blood’s ability to clot, they can increase the risk of severe bleeding and heavy blood loss. It is thus essential to take these drugs exactly as directed and to see a physician regularly as long as they are prescribed. | No
5519 | Title | Description | No
5520 | NarrativeText | Anticoagulant drugs, also called anticlotting drugs or blood thinners, are available only with a physician’s prescription. They come in tablet and injectable forms. They fall into three groups: + Inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis. These anticoagu- lants inhibit the production of certain clotting factors in | No
5521 | Title | 250 | No
5522 | NarrativeText | the liver. One example is warfarin (brand name: coumadin). | No
5523 | ListItem | ¢ Inhibitors of thrombin. Thrombin inhibitors interfere with blood clotting by blocking the activity of throm- bin. They include heparin, lepirudin (Refludan). | No
5524 | ListItem | + Antiplatelet drugs. Antiplatelet drugs interact with platelets, which is a type of blood cell, to block platelets from aggregating into harmful clots. They include: aspirin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plav- ix), tirofiban (Aggrastat), and eptifibatide (Integrilin). | No
5525 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
5526 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of anticoagulant drug and the medical condition for which it is prescribed. The prescribing physician or the pharmacist who filled the prescription can provide information con- cerning the correct dosage. Usually, the physician will adjust the dose after checking the patient’s clotting time. | No
5527 | NarrativeText | Anticoagulant drugs must be taken exactly as direct- ed by the physician. Larger or more frequent doses should not be taken, and the drug should also not be taken for longer than prescribed. Taking too much of this medication can cause severe bleeding. Anticoagulants should also be taken on schedule. A record of each dose should be kept as it is taken. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible followed by the regular dose schedule. However, a patient who forgets to take a missed dose until the next day should not take the missed dose at all and should not double the next dose, as this could lead to bleeding. A record of all missed doses should be kept for the prescribing physician who should be informed at the scheduled visits. | No
5528 | Title | Precautions | No
5529 | NarrativeText | Persons who take anticoagulants should see a physi- cian regularly while taking these drugs, particularly at the beginning of therapy. The physician will order peri- odic blood tests to check the blood’s clotting ability. The results of these tests will help the physician determine the proper amount of medication to be taken each day. | No
5530 | NarrativeText | Time is required for normal clotting ability to return after anticoagulant treatment. During this period, patients must observe the same precautions they observed while taking the drug. The length of time needed for the blood to return to normal depends on the type of anticoagulant drug that was taken. The prescribing physician will advise as to how long the precautions should be observed. | No
5531 | NarrativeText | People who are taking anticoagulant drugs should tell all physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and other med- ical professionals who provide medical treatments or ser- vices to them that they are taking such a medication. | No
5532 | NarrativeText | They should also carry identification stating that they are using an anticoagulant drug. | No
5533 | NarrativeText | Other prescription drugs or over-the-counter medi- cine—especially aspirin—should be not be taken without the prescribing physician being informed. | No
5534 | NarrativeText | Because of the risk of heavy bleeding, anyone who takes an anticoagulant drug must take care to avoid injuries. Sports and other potentially hazardous activities should be avoided. Any falls, blows to the body or head, or other injuries should be reported to a physician, as internal bleeding may occur without any obvious symp- toms. Special care should be taken in shaving and in brushing and flossing the teeth. Soft toothbrushes should be used and the flossing should be very gentle. Electric razors should be used instead of a blade. | No
5535 | NarrativeText | Alcohol can change the way anticoagulant drugs affect the body. Anyone who takes this medicine should not have more than one to two drinks at any time and should not drink alcohol every day. | No
5536 | Title | Special conditions | No
5537 | NarrativeText | People with specific medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take anticoagulant drugs. Before taking these drugs, the prescribing physician should be informed about any of these conditions: ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to anticoagulants in the past should let his or her physi- cian know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to beef, pork, or other foods; dyes; preservatives; or other substances. | No
5538 | NarrativeText | PREGNANCY. Anticoagulants may cause many seri- ous problems if taken during pregnancy. Birth defects, severe bleeding in the fetus, and other problems that affect the physical or mental development of the fetus or newborn are possible. The mother may also experience severe bleeding if she takes anticoagulants during preg- nancy, during delivery, or even shortly after delivery. Women should not take start taking anticoagulants dur- ing pregnancy and should not become pregnant while taking it. Any woman who becomes pregnant or suspects that she has become pregnant while taking an anticoagu- lant should check with her physician immediately. | No
5539 | NarrativeText | BREASTFEEDING. Some anticoagulant drugs may pass into breast milk. Blood tests can be done on nursing babies to see whether the drug is causing any problems. If it is, other medication may be prescribed to counteract the effects of the anticoagulant drug. | No
5540 | NarrativeText | OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti- coagulant drugs, people should inform their physician about any medical problems they have. They should also let the physician who prescribed the medicine know if they are being treated by any other medical physician or dentist. In addition, people who will be taking anticoagu- lant drugs should let their physician know if they have recently had any of the following: + fever lasting more than one to two days | No

5545 | NarrativeText | USE OF CERTAIN FOODS AND MEDICINES. Many foods and drugs may affect the way the anticoagulant drugs work or may increase the risk of side effects. | No
5546 | Title | Side effects | No
5547 | NarrativeText | The most common minor side effects are bloating or gas. These problems usually go away as the body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical treatment. | No
5548 | NarrativeText | More serious side effects may occur, especially if excessive anticoagulant is taken. If any of the following side effects occur, a physician should be notified imme- diately: * bleeding gums * sores or white spots in the mouth or throat | No

5571 | NarrativeText | In addition, patients taking anticoagulant drugs should check with their physicians as soon as possible if any of these side effects occur: * nausea or vomiting ¢ diarrhea | No
5572 | NarrativeText | Diet also affects the way anticoagulant drugs work in the body. A normal, balanced diet should be followed every day while taking such medication. No dietary changes should be made without informing first the pre- scribing physician, who should also be told of any illness or other condition interfering with the ability to eat nor- mally. Diet is a very important consideration because the amount of vitamin K in the body affects how anticoagu- lant drugs work. Dicoumarol and warfarin act by reduc- ing the effects of vitamin K. Vitamin K is found in meats, dairy products, leafy, green vegetables, and some multi- ple vitamins and nutritional supplements. For the drugs to work properly, it is best to have the same amount of vitamin K in the body all the time. Foods containing vita- min K in the diet should not be increased or decreased without consulting with the prescribing physician. If the patient takes vitamin supplements, he should check the label to see if it contains vitamin K. Because vitamin K is also produced by intestinal bacteria, a severe case of diarrhea or the use of laxatives may also alter a person’s vitamin K levels. | No

5580 | Title | 252 | No
5581 | Title | Purpose | No
5582 | NarrativeText | Anticonvulsant drugs are used to control seizures in people with epilepsy. Epilepsy is not a single disease—it is a set of symptoms that may have different causes in different people. The common thread is an imbalance in the brain’s electrical activity. This imbalance causes seizures that may affect part or all of the body and may or may not cause a loss of consciousness. Anticonvulsant drugs act on the brain to reduce the frequency and severi- ty of seizures. | No
5583 | NarrativeText | Some cases of epilepsy are brought on by head injuries, brain tumors or infections, or metabolic prob- lems such as low blood sugar. But in some people with epilepsy, the cause is not clear. | No
5584 | NarrativeText | Anticonvulsant drugs are an important part of the treatment program for epilepsy. Different kinds of drugs may be prescribed for different types of seizures. In addi- tion to taking medicine, patients with epilepsy should get enough rest, avoid stress, and practice good health habits. | No
5585 | NarrativeText | Some physicians believe that giving the drugs to children with epilepsy may prevent the condition from getting worse in later life. However, others say the effects are the same, whether treatment is started early or later in life. Determining when treatment begins depends on the physician and his assessment of the patient’s symptoms. | No
5586 | NarrativeText | Physicians also prescribe certain anticonvulsant drugs for other conditions, including bipolar disorder and migraine headaches. | No
5587 | Title | Description | No
5588 | NarrativeText | Anticonvulsant drugs may be divided into several classes. The hydantoins include pheytoin (Dilantin) and mephenytoin (Mesantoin.) Ther succimides include etho- suximide (Zarontin)and methsuccimide (Celontin.) The benzodiazepines, which are better known for their use as tranquilizers and sedatives, include clonazepam (Klonopin), clorazepate (Tranxene) and diazepam (Vali- um.) There are also a large number of other drugs which are not related to larger groups. These include carba- mazepine (Tegretol), valproic acid (Depakote, Depak- ene) gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax), fel- bamate (Felbatol) and several others. Phenobarbital has been used as an anticonvulsant, and is still useful for some patients. The drugs are available only with a physi- cian’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liquid, and “sprinkle” forms. | No
5589 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
5590 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of anticonvulsant, its strength, and the type of seizures for which it is being taken. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre- scription for the correct dosage. | No
5591 | NarrativeText | Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak- ing it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering the dose may reduce the chance of withdrawal effects. | No
5592 | NarrativeText | Do not change brands or dosage forms of this medi- cine without checking with a pharmacist or physician. If a prescription refill does not look like the original medicine, check with the pharmacist who filled the prescription. | No
5593 | Title | Precautions | No
5594 | NarrativeText | Patients on anticonvulsant drugs should see a physi- cian regularly while on therapy, especially during the first few months. The physician will check to make sure the medicine is working as it should and will note unwanted side effects. The physician may also need to adjust the dosage during this period. | No
5595 | NarrativeText | Valproic acid can cause serious liver damage, espe- cially in the first 6 months of treatment. Children are par- ticularly at risk, but anyone taking this medicine should see their physician regularly for tests of liver function and should be alert to symptoms of liver damage, such as yel- low skin and eyes, facial swelling, loss of appetite, gener- al feeling of illness, loss of appetite, and vomiting. If liver problems are suspected, call a physician immediately. | No
5596 | NarrativeText | Felbatol has caused serious liver damage and aplas- tic anemia, a condition in which the bone marrow stops producing blood cells. Patients taking this drug should have regular blood counts, and should stop taking the drug if there are too few red blood cells. | No
5597 | NarrativeText | While taking anticonvulsant drugs, do not start or stop taking any other medicines without checking with a physician. The other medicines may affect the way the anticonvulsant medicine works. | No
5598 | NarrativeText | Because anticonvulsant drugs work on the central nervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and other drugs that slow down the central nervous sys- tem, such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, other medicine for seizures, tran- quilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. Anyone taking anticonvulsant drugs should check with his or her physician before drinking alcohol or taking any medicines that slow the central nervous system. | No
5599 | NarrativeText | Anticonvulsant drugs may interact with medicines used during surgery, dental procedures, or emergency treatment. These interactions could increase the chance of side effects. Anyone who is taking anticonvulsant drugs should be sure to tell the health care professional in charge before having any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emergency treatment. | No
5600 | Title | 253 | No
5601 | NarrativeText | Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less alert when using these drugs, especially when they first begin taking them or when their dosage is increased. Anyone who takes anticonvulsant drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else that might be danger- ous until they have found out how the drugs affect them. | No
5602 | NarrativeText | Anticonvulsant drugs may affect the results of certain medical tests. Before having medical tests, people who take anticonvulsant drugs should make sure that the med- ical professional in charge knows what they are taking. | No
5603 | NarrativeText | Children may be more likely to have certain side effects from anticonvulsant drugs, such as behavior changes; tender, bleeding, or swollen gums; enlarged facial features; and excessive hair growth. Problems with the gums may be prevented by regularly brushing and flossing, massaging the gums, and having the teeth cleaned every 3 months whether the patient is a child or an adult. | No
5604 | NarrativeText | Children who take high doses of this medicine for a long time may have problems in school. | No
5605 | NarrativeText | Older people may be more sensitive to the effects of anticonvulsant drugs. This may increase the chance of side effects and overdoses. | No
5606 | Title | Special conditions | No
5607 | NarrativeText | People with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take anticonvulsant drugs. Before taking these drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of these condi- tions: ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to anticonvulsant drugs or to tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil) or desipramine (Nor- pramin) in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
5608 | NarrativeText | PREGNANCY. Birth defects have been reported in babies born to mothers who took anticonvulsant drugs during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should check with their physicians about the safety of using anticonvulsant drugs during pregnancy. | No
5609 | NarrativeText | Some anticonvulsant drugs taken during pregnancy may cause bleeding problems in the mother during deliv- ery and in the baby after delivery. This problem can be avoided by giving vitamin K to the mother during deliv- ery and to the baby after birth. | No

5669 | Title | Purpose | No
5670 | NarrativeText | Depressive disorders may be either unipolar (depres- sion alone) or bipolar (depression alternating with peri- ods of extreme excitation). The formal diagnosis requires a cluster of symptoms, lasting at least two weeks. These symptoms include, but are not limited to mood changes, insomnia or hypersomnia, and diminished interest in daily activities. The symptoms are not caused by any medical condition, drug side effect, or adverse life event. The condition is severe enough to cause clinically signif- icant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. | No

5674 | NarrativeText | Antidepressant agents act by increasing the levels of excitatory neurostransmitters. The main types of antide- pressant drugs in use today are: * tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor) | No

5677 | ListItem | *tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants which do not fall into any of the above categories Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors maintain lev- els of the excitatory neurohormone serotonin in the brain. They do not alter levels of norepinephrine. These have become the drugs of choice for a variety of psychi- atric disorders, primarily because of their low incidence of severe side effects as compared with other drugs in this therapeutic class. SSRIs show similar actions and side effect profiles, but may vary in duration of action. | No
5678 | NarrativeText | Tricyclic compounds, identified by their chemical structure containing three carbon rings, are an older class of antidepressants. Although generally effective, they have a high incidence of anticholinergic effects, notably dry mouth and dry eyes, which can cause discomfort. They also cause cardiac arrythmias. Because tricyclics act on both serotonin and norepinephrine, they may have some value in treatment of patients who fail to respond to SSRIs. Drugs in this class are often available at low prices, which may be significant when cost is a major factor in treatment. They have also been found useful in control of some neurologic pain syndromes. | No
5679 | NarrativeText | Tricyclic antidepressants are similar, but may vary in severity of side effects, most notably the degree of seda- tion and the extent of the anticholinergic effects. | No
5680 | NarrativeText | Tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants are chemically distinct from both the major groups and each other. Although maprotilene (no brand name, mar- keted in generic form only) and mirtazepine (Remeron) are similar in chemical structures, they differ in their bal- ance of activity on serotonine and norepinephrine levels. | No

They act by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which is responsible for the metabolism of the stimulatory neuro- hormones norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. The MAOIs are normally reserved for patients who are resistant to safer drugs. Two drugs, eldepryl (Carbex, used in treatment of Parkinson’s disease) and the herb, St. John’s wort, have some action against monoamine oxidase B, and have shown some value as anti-depressants. They do not share the same risks as the non-selective MAO inhibitors. | No
5683 | NarrativeText | All antidepressant agents, regardless of their struc- ture, have a slow onset of action, typically three to five weeks. Although adverse effects may be seen as early as the first dose, significant therapeutic improvement is always delayed.

5686 | NarrativeText | Tricyclic antidepressants. Amoxepine (not marketed by brand, generic available), although a tricyclic antide- pressant rather than a neuroleptic (major tranquilizer), displays some of the more serious effects of the neu- roleptics, including tardive dyskinesias (drug induced involuntary movements) and neuroleptic malignant syn- drome, a potentially fatal syndrome whose symptoms include high fever, altered mental status, irregular pulse or blood pressure, and changes in heart rate. These adverse effects have not been reported with other tri- cyclic antidepressants. | No
5687 | NarrativeText | The most common adverse effects of tricyclic antide- pressants are sedation and the anticholinergic effects, such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and difficult urination. Alter- ations in heartbeat are also common, and may progress to congestive heart failure, stroke, and sudden death. | No

5713 | Title | Purpose | No
5714 | NarrativeText | Since their discovery in the 1950s, tricyclic antide- pressants have been used to treat mental depression. Like other antidepressant drugs, they reduce symptoms such as extreme sadness, hopelessness, and lack of energy. Some tricyclic antidepressants are also used to treat bulimia, cocaine withdrawal, panic disorder, obsessive- compulsive disorders, certain types of chronic pain, and bed-wetting in children. | No
5715 | Title | Description | No
5716 | NarrativeText | Named for their three-ring chemical structure, tri- cyclic antidepressants work by correcting chemical imbalances in the brain. But because they also affect other chemicals throughout the body, these drugs may produce many unwanted side effects. | No
5717 | NarrativeText | Tricyclic antidepressants are available only with a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectable forms. Some commonly used tri- cyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline (Elavil), desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil), nor- triptyline (Pamelor), and protriptyline (Vivactil). Differ- ent drugs in this family have different effects, and physi- cians can choose the drug that best fits the patient’s symp- toms. For example, a physician might prescribe Elavil for a person with depression who has trouble sleeping, because this drug is more likely to make people feel calm and sleepy. Other tricyclic antidepressants might be more appropriate for depressed people with low energy. | No
5718 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
5719 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on many factors, including the patient’s age, weight, general health and symptoms. The type of tricyclic antidepressant and its strength also must be considered. Check with the physi- cian who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage. | No
5720 | NarrativeText | Always take tricyclic antidepressants exactly as directed. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take the drug for longer than directed. Do not stop taking the medicine just because it does not seem to be working. Several weeks may be needed for its effects to be felt. Visit the physician as often as recommended so that the physician can check to see if the drug is working and to note for side effects. | No
5721 | NarrativeText | Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak- ing it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering the dose may be necessary to reduce the chance of withdraw- al symptoms. | No

5725 | NarrativeText | Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded, when taking these drugs. The drugs may also cause blurred vision. Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else that might be dangerous until they have found out how the drugs affect them. | No
5726 | NarrativeText | Because tricyclic antidepressants work on the central nervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and other drugs that cause drowsiness, such as antihista- mines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, medi- cine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. Anyone taking tricyclic antidepres- sants should check with his or her physician before drink- ing alcohol or taking any drugs that cause drowsiness. | No
5727 | NarrativeText | These medicines make some people feel lighthead- ed, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lying down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and hold onto something for support if possible. | No
5728 | NarrativeText | Tricyclic antidepressants may interact with medi- cines used during surgery, dental procedures, or emer- gency treatment. These interactions could increase the chance of side effects. Anyone who is taking tricyclic antidepressants should be sure to tell the health care pro- fessional in charge before having any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emergency treatment. | No
5729 | NarrativeText | These drugs may also change the results of medical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care professional in charge. | No

5793 | NarrativeText | Diabetes may be divided into type I and type II, for- merly termed juvenile onset or insulin-dependent, and maturity onset or non insulin-dependent. Type I is caused by a deficiency of insulin production, while type II is characterized by insulin resistance. | No
5794 | NarrativeText | Treatment of type I diabetes is limited to insulin replacement, while type II diabetes is treatable by a num- ber of therapeutic approaches. Many cases of insulin resistance are asymptomatic due to normal increases in insulin secretion, and others may be controlled by diet and exercise. Drug therapy may be directed towards increasing insulin secretion, increasing insulin sensitivi- ty, or increasing insulin penetration of the cells. | No
5795 | Title | Description | No
5796 | NarrativeText | Antidiabetic drugs may be subdivided into six groups: insulin, sufonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones. | No
5797 | NarrativeText | Insulin (Humulin, Novolin) is the hormone responsi- ble for glucose utilization. It is effective in both types of diabetes, since, even in insulin resistance, some sensitivi- ty remains and the condition can be treated with larger doses of insulin. Most insulins are now produced by recombinant DNA techniques, and are chemically identi- cal to natural human insulin. Isophane insulin suspen- sion, insulin zinc suspension, and other formulations are intended to extend the duration of action of insulin, and permit glucose control over longer periods of time. | No
5798 | NarrativeText | Sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide [Diabinese], tolaza- mide [Tolinase], glipizide [Glucotrol] and others) act by increasing insulin release from the beta cells of the pan- crease. Glimepiride (Amaryl), a member of this class, appears to have a useful secondary action in increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral cells. | No
5799 | NarrativeText | Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose [Precose], miglitol [Glyset]) do not enhance insulin secretion. Rather, they inhibit the conversion of disaccharides and complex carbohydrates to glucose. This mechanism does not prevent conversion, but only delays it, reducing the peak blood glucose levels. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are useful for either monotherapy or in combination ther- apy with sulfonylureas or other hypoglycemic agents. | No
5800 | NarrativeText | Metformin (Glucophage) is the only available mem- ber of the biguanide class. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and uti- lization. Metformin may be used as monotherapy, or in combination therapy with a sulfonylurea. | No
5801 | NarrativeText | There are two members of the meglitinide class: repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglitinide (Starlix). The mechanism of action of the meglitinides is to stimulate insulin production. This activity is both dose dependent and dependent on the presence of glucose, so that the | No

5803 | NarrativeText | drugs have reduced effectiveness in the presence of low blood glucose levels. The meglitinides may be used alone, or in combination with metformin. The manufacturer warns that nateglitinide should not be used in combina- tion with other drugs which enhance insulin secretion. | No
5804 | NarrativeText | Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) and the members of the thiazolidinedione class. They act by both reducing glucose production in the liver, and increasing insulin dependent glucose uptake in muscle cells. They do not increase insulin production. These drugs may be used in combination with metoformin or a sulfonylurea. | No

5808 | NarrativeText | Insulin. The greatest short term risk of insulin is hypoglycemia, which may be the result of either a direct overdose or an imbalance between insulin injection and level of exercise and diet. This may also occur in the presence of other conditions which reduce the glucose load, such as illness with vomiting and diarrhea. Treat- ment is with glucose in the form of glucose tablets or liq- uid, although severe cases may require intravenous thera- py. Allergic reactions and skin reactions may also occur. Insulin is classified as category B in pregnancy, and is considered the drug of choice for glucose control during pregnancy. Insulin glargine (Lantus), an insulin analog which is suitable for once-daily dosing, is classified as category C, because there have been reported changes in the hearts of newborns in animal studies of this drug. The reports are essentially anecdotal, and no cause and effect relationship has been determined. Insulin is not recom- mended during breast feeding because either low of high doses of insulin may inhibit milk production. Insulin administered orally is destroyed in the GI tract, and rep- resents no risk to the newborn. | No
5809 | NarrativeText | Sulonylureas. All sulfonylurea drugs may cause hypoglycemia. Most patients become resistant to these drugs over time, and may require either dose adjustments or a switch to insulin. The list of adverse reactions is extensive, and includes central nervous system problems and skin reactions, among others. Hematologic reactions, although rare, may be severe and include aplastic ane- mia and hemolytic anemia. The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared with treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. The sulfonylureas are classified as category C during pregnancy, based on ani- Antidiabetic Drugs Brand Name(Generic Name) Possible Common Side Effects Include: Diabinese (chlorpropamide) Glucotrol (glipizide) *Insulin Micronase (glyburide) orinase (tolbutamide) Diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite Dizziness, fatigue, headache, nervousness Nausea, heartburn, bloating Nausea, heartburn, bloating Mild allergic reactions, decreased blood pressure, rash, shortness of breath *Insulin is the generic name for several brands which may be animal-based, human-based, or synthetic. | No

Because there may be significant alterations in blood glucose levels during pregnancy, it is recommended that patients be switch to insulin. These drugs have not been fully studied during breast feeding, but it is recommended that because their presence in breast milk might cause hypo- glycemia in the newborn, breastfeeding be avoided while taking sulfonylureas. | No
5811 | NarrativeText | Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are generally well tol- erated, and do not cause hypoglycemia. The most com- mon adverse effects are gastrointestinal problems, including flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These drugs are classified as category B in pregnancy. Although there is no evidence that the drugs are harmful to the fetus, it is important that rigid blood glucose con- trol be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnant women should be switched to insulin. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors may be excreted in small amounts in breast milk, and it is recommended that the drugs not be admin- istered to nursing mothers. | No

5813 | NarrativeText | Thiazolidinediones. These drugs are generally well tolerated, however they are structurally related to an ear- lier drug, troglitazone, which was associated with liver function problems. It is strongly recommended that all patients treated with pioglitazone or rosiglitazone have regular liver function monitoring. The drugs are classi- fied as pregnancy category C, based on evidence of inhi- bition of fetal growth in rats given more than four times the normal human dose. It is important that rigid blood glucose control be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnant women should be switched to insulin. It is not known whether the thiazolidinediones are excreted in human milk, however they have been identified in the milk of lactating rats. It is recommended that these drugs not be administered to nursing mothers. | No
5814 | NarrativeText | Metformin causes gastrointestinal reactions in about a third of patients. A rare, but very serious, reaction to metformin is lactic acidosis, which is fatal in about 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis occurs in patients with multiple medical problems, including renal insufficiency. The risk may be reduced with careful renal monitoring, and care- ful dose adjustments to metformin. Metformin is catego- ry B during pregnancy. There have been no carefully controlled studies of the drug during pregnancy, but there is no evidence of fetal harm from animal studies. It is important that rigid blood glucose control be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnant women should be switched to insulin. Animal studies show that metformin is excreted in milk. It is recommended that metformin not be administered to nursing mothers. | No

5839 | Title | 264 | No
5840 | Title | Purpose | No
5841 | NarrativeText | Antidiarrheal drugs help control diarrhea and some of the symptoms that go along with it. An average, healthy person has anywhere from three bowel move- ments a day to three a week, depending on that person’s diet. Normally the stool (the material that is passed in a bowel movement) has a texture something like clay. With diarrhea, bowel movements may be more frequent, and the texture of the stool is thin and sometimes watery. | No
5842 | NarrativeText | Diarrhea is not a disease, but a symptom of some other problem. The symptom may be caused by eating or drink- ing food or water that is contaminated with bacteria, virus- es, or parasites, or by eating something that is difficult to digest. People who have trouble digesting lactose (milk sugar), for example, may get diarrhea if they eat dairy products. Some cases of diarrhea are caused by stress, while others are brought on by taking certain medicines. | No
5843 | Title | Description | No
5844 | NarrativeText | Antidiarrheal drugs work in several ways. The drug loperamide, found in Imodium A-D, for example, slows the passage of stools through the intestines. This allows more time for water and salts in the stools to be absorbed back into the body. Adsorbents, such as atta- pulgite (found in Kaopectate) pull diarrhea-causing sub- stances from the digestive tract. However, they may also pull out substances that the body needs, such as enzymes and nutrients. Bismuth subsalicylate, the ingre- dient in Pepto-Bismol, decreases the secretion of fluid into the intestine and inhibits the activity of bacteria. It not only controls diarrhea, but relieves the cramps that often accompany diarrhea. | No
5845 | NarrativeText | These medicines come in liquid, tablet, caplet, and chewable tablet forms and can be bought without a physician’s prescription. | No
5846 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
5847 | NarrativeText | The dose depends on the type of antidiarrheal drug. Read and follow the directions on the product label. For questions about dosage, check with a physician or phar- macist. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take the drug for longer than directed. | No
5848 | Title | Precautions | No
5849 | NarrativeText | Diarrhea usually improves within 24-48 hours. If the problem lasts longer or if it keeps coming back, diarrhea could be a sign of a more serious problem. Anyone who has any of the symptoms listed below should get medical attention as soon as possible: diarrhea that lasts more than two days or gets worse * fever | No
5850 | ListItem | + blood in the stool * vomiting | No
5851 | ListItem | * cramps or tenderness in the abdomen «Signs of dehydration, such as decreased urination, dizziness or lightheadedness, dry mouth, increased thirst, or wrinkled skin | No
5852 | NarrativeText | Do not use antidiarrheal drugs for more than two days unless told to do so by a physician. | No
5853 | NarrativeText | Severe, long-lasting diarrhea can lead to dehydra- tion. In such cases, lost fluids and salts, such as calcium, sodium, and potassium, must be replaced. | No
5854 | NarrativeText | People older than 60 should not use attapulgite (Kaopectate, Donnagel, Parepectolin), but may use other kinds of antidiarrheal drugs. However, people in this age group may be more likely to have side effects, such as severe constipation, from bismuth subsalicylate. Ask the pharmacist for more information. | No
5855 | NarrativeText | Bismuth subsalicylate may cause the tongue or the stool to temporarily darken. This is harmless. However, do not confuse this harmless darkening of the stool with the black, tarry stools that are a sign of bleeding in the intestinal tract. | No
5856 | NarrativeText | Children with flu or chicken pox should not be given bismuth subsalicylate. It can lead to Reye’s syndrome, a life-threatening condition that affects the liver and central nervous system. To be safe, never give bismuth subsalicy- late to a child under 16 years without consulting a physi- cian. Children may have unpredictable reactions to other antidiarrheal drugs. Loperamide should not be given to chil- dren under six years and attapulgite should not be given to children under three years unless directed by a physician. | No
5857 | NarrativeText | Anyone who has a history of liver disease or who has been taking antibiotics should check with his or her physician before taking the antidiarrheal drug lop- eramide. A physician should also be consulted before anyone with acute ulcerative colitis or anyone who has been advised to avoid constipation uses the drug. | No

5868 | NarrativeText | The most common side effects of attapulgite are con- stipation, bloating, and fullness. Bismuth subsalicylate may cause ringing in the ears, but that side effect is rare. Possible side effects from loperamide include skin rash, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, tiredness, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and swelling, pain, and discomfort in the abdomen. Some of these symptoms are the same as those that occur with diarrhea, so it may be difficult to tell if the medicine is causing the problems. Children may be more sensitive than adults to certain side effects of lop- eramide, such as drowsiness and dizziness. | No

5885 | NarrativeText | An ADH test is used to aid in the diagnosis of dia- betes insipidus or the syndrome of inappropriate ADH called SIADH. | No
5886 | Title | Precautions | No
5887 | NarrativeText | Certain drugs can either increase or decrease ADH levels. Drugs that increase ADH levels include aceta- minophen, barbiturates, cholinergic agents, estrogen, nicotine, oral hypoglycemia agents, some diuretics (e.g., thiazides), cyclophosphamide, narcotics, and tri- cyclic antidepressants. Drugs that decrease ADH levels include alcohol, beta-adrenergic agents, morphine antag- onists, and phenytoin (Dilantin). | No
5888 | Title | Description | No
5889 | NarrativeText | The purpose of ADH is to control the amount of water reabsorbed by the kidneys. Water is continually being taken into the body in food and drink, as well as being produced by chemical reactions in cells. Water is also continually lost in urine, sweat, feces, and in the breath as water vapor. ADH release helps maintain the optimum amount of water in the body when there is an increase in the concentration of the blood serum or a decrease in blood volume. Physical stress, surgery, and high levels of anxiety can also stimulate ADH. | No
5890 | NarrativeText | Various factors can affect ADH production, thereby disturbing the body’s water balance. For example, alcohol consumption reduces ADH production by direct action on the brain, resulting in a temporarily increased production of urine. This may also occur in diabetes insipidus, when the pituitary gland produces insufficient ADH, or rarely, when the kidneys fail to respond to ADH. The reverse effect of water retention can result from temporarily increased ADH production after a major operation or accident. Water retention may also be caused by the secretion of ADH by some tumors, especially of the lung. | No
5891 | Title | Preparation | No
5892 | NarrativeText | The test requires collection of a blood sample. The patient must be fasting (nothing to eat or drink) for 12 hours, be adequately hydrated, and limit physical activity for 10-12 hours before the test. | No

5912 | Title | Purpose | No
5913 | NarrativeText | Systemic antifungal drugs are used to treat infec- tions in various parts of the body that are caused by a fungus. A fungus is an organism that can be either one- celled or filamentous. Unlike a plant, which makes its own food, or an animal, which eats plants or other ani- mals, a fungus survives by invading and living off other living things. Fungi thrive in moist, dark places, includ- ing some parts of the body. | No
5914 | NarrativeText | Fungal infections can either be systemic, meaning that the infection is deep, or topical (dermatophytic), meaning that the infection is superficial and occurs on the skin. Additionally, yeast infections can affect the mucous membranes of the body. Fungal infections on the skin are usually treated with creams or ointments (topical antifun- gal drugs). However, systemic infections, yeast infections or topical infections that do not clear up after treatment with creams or ointments may need to be treated with sys- temic antifungal drugs. These drugs are used, for example, to treat common fungal infections such as tinea (ring- worm), which occurs on the skin or candidiasis (a yeast infection, also known as trush), which can occur in the throat, in the vagina, or in other parts of the body. They are also used to treat other deep fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis, which can affect the lungs and other organs. They are sometimes used to prevent or treat fungal infections in people whose immune systems are weakened, such as bone marrow or organ transplant patients and people with AIDS. | No

5918 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
5919 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of antifungal drug and the nature and extent of fungal infec- tion being treated. Doses may also be different for differ- ent patients. The prescribing physician or the pharmacist can provide dosage information. Systemic antifungal drugs must be taken exactly as directed. Itraconazole and ketoconazole should be taken with food. | No
5920 | NarrativeText | Fungal infections can take a long time to clear up, so it may be necessary to take the medication for several months, or even for a year or longer. It is very important to keep taking the medicine for as long as the physician says to take it, even if symptoms seem to improve. If the drug is stopped too soon, the symptoms may return. | No

5985 | NarrativeText | There are a large number of drugs currently avail- able in topical form for fungal infections. Other than the imidazoles, (miconazole [Micatin, Miconazole], clotri- mazole [Lotrimin], econazole [Spectazole], ketoconazole [Nizoral], oxiconazole [Oxistat], sulconazole [Exel- derm]) and the allylamine derivatives (butenafine [Men- tax], naftifine [Naftin], terbinafine [Lamisil]), the drugs in this therapeutic class are chemically distinct from each other. All drugs when applied topically have a good mar- gin of safety, and most show a high degree of effective- ness. There are no studies comparing drugs on which to base a recommendation for drugs of choice. Although some of the topical antifungals are available over-the- counter, they may be as effective as prescription drugs for this purpose. | No
5986 | NarrativeText | Traditional antifungal drugs such as undecylinic acid (Cruex, Desenex) and gentian violet (also known as crystal violet) remain available, but have a lower cure rate (complete eradication of fungus) than the newer agents and are not recommended.

6007 | NarrativeText | Antigas agents are medicines that relieve the uncom- fortable symptoms of too much gas in the stomach and intestines. | No
6008 | Title | Purpose | No
6009 | NarrativeText | Excess gas can build up in the stomach and intestines for a number of reasons. Eating high-fiber foods, such as beans, grains, and vegetables is one cause. Some people unconsciously swallow air when they eat, drink, chew gum, or smoke cigarettes, which can lead to uncomfortable amounts of gas in the diges- tive system. Surgery and certain medical conditions, such as irritable colon, peptic ulcer, and diverticulosis, can also lead to gas build-up. Certain intestinal parasites can contribute to the production of severe gas - these parasites need to be treated separately with special drugs. Abdominal pain, pressure, bloating, and flatu- lence are signs of too much gas. Antigas agents help relieve the symptoms by preventing the formation of gas pockets and breaking up gas that already is trapped in the stomach and intestines. | No
6010 | Title | Description | No
6011 | NarrativeText | Antigas agents are sold as capsules, liquids, and tablets (regular and chewable) and can be bought without a physician’s prescription. Some commonly used brands are Gas-X, Flatulex, Mylanta Gas Relief, Di-Gel, and Phazyme. The ingredient that helps relieve excess gas is simethicone.

6032 | Title | Purpose | No
6033 | NarrativeText | The drug discussed here, cisapride (Propulsid), is used to treat nighttime heartburn resulting from gas- troesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this condition, food and stomach juices flow backward from the stom- ach into the esophagus, the part of the digestive tract through which food passes on its way from the mouth to the stomach. Normally, a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) opens to allow food into the stomach and then closes to prevent the stomach’s con- tents from flowing back into the esophagus. In people with GERD, this muscular ring is either weak or it relax- es at the wrong times. The main symptom is heartburn— a burning sensation centered behind the breastbone and spreading upward toward the neck and throat. | No
6034 | NarrativeText | Cisapride works by strengthening the lower esophageal sphincter and making the stomach empty more quickly. This shortens the amount of time that the esophagus comes in contact with the stomach contents. | No

6069 | NarrativeText | Antihelminthic drugs are used to treat parasitic infestations. | No
6070 | Title | Purpose | No
6071 | NarrativeText | Parasitic infestations are caused by protozoa or worms gaining entry into the body. Most of these organ- isms cause infections by being ingested in the form of eggs or larvae, usually present on contaminated food or clothing, while others gain entry through skin abrasions. Common parasitic infestations include amebiasis, malar- ia, giardiasis, hookworm, pinworm, threadworm, whip- worm and tapeworm infestations. Once in the body, para- sitic worms may go unnoticed if they cause no severe symptoms. However, if they multiply rapidly and spread to a major organ, they can cause very serious and even life- threatening conditions. Antihelminthic drugs are pre- scribed to treat these infestations. They function either by destroying the worms on contact or by paralyzing them, or by altering the permeability of their plasma membranes. The dead worms then pass out of the body in the feces. | No
6072 | Title | Description | No
6073 | NarrativeText | Antihelminthic drugs are available only with a pre- scription and are available as liquids, tablets or capsules. Some commonly used antihelminthics include: albenda- zole (Albenza), mebendazole (Vermox), niclosamide (Niclocide), oxamniquine (Vansil), praziquantel (Biltri- cide), pyrantel (Antiminth), pyantel pamoate (Antiminth) and thiabendazole (Mintezol). Some types of parasitic infestations are rarely seen in the United States, thus, the corresponding antihelminthic drugs are not widely dis- tributed and need to be obtained from the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) when required. These include for example bitional and ivermectin, used to treat onchocerciasis infestations. Other antihelminthic drugs, such as diethylcarbamazepine citrate (Hetrezan), used for treatment of roundworms and other parasites, is sup- plied directly by its manufacturer when needed. | No
6074 | NarrativeText | Most antihelminthic drugs are only active against spe- cific parasites, some are also toxic. Before treatment, the parasites must therefore be identified using tests that look for parasites, eggs or larvae in feces, urine, blood, sputum, or tissues. Thus, niclosamide is used against tapeworms, but will not be effective for the treatment of pinworm or roundworm infestations, because it acts by inhibiting ATP production in tapeworm cells. Thiabendazole (Mintezole) is the drug usually prescribed for treatment of thread- worm, but a similar drug, mebendazole (Vermox) works | No

A second round of treatment may be required to ensure that the infection has completely cleared. | No
6102 | Title | 274 | No
6103 | Title | Precautions | No
6104 | NarrativeText | Some antihelminthic drugs work best when ingested along with fatty foods, such as milk or ice cream. Oral drugs should be taken with water during or after meals. The prescribing physician should be informed if the patient has a low-fat or other special diet. | No
6105 | NarrativeText | Some antihelminthic drugs, such as praziquantel, come in chewable form. These tablets should not be chewed or kept in the mouth, but should swallowed whole because their bitter taste may cause gagging or vomiting. | No
6106 | NarrativeText | Antihelminthic drugs sometimes need to be taken with other medications. For example, steroids such as prednisone are also prescribed together with the anti- helminthic drug for tapeworm to reduce the inflamma- tion that the worm may cause. | No
6107 | NarrativeText | When required, pre- or post-treatment purges are also performed with magnesium or sodium sulfate. | No
6108 | NarrativeText | Regular medical visits are recommended for people affected by parasitic infestations. The physician monitors whether the infection is clearing or not and also keeps track of unwanted side effects. The prescribing physician should be informed if symptoms do not disappear or if they get worse. | No
6109 | NarrativeText | Hookworm or whipworm infections are also treated with iron supplements along with the antihelminthic pre- scription. | No
6110 | NarrativeText | Some types of parasitic infestations (e.g. pinworms) can be passed from one person to another. It is then often recommended that everyone in the household of an infected person be asked to also take the prescribed anti- helminthic drug. | No
6111 | Title | Risks | No
6112 | NarrativeText | People with the following medical conditions may have adverse reactions to antihelminthic drugs. The pre- scribing physician should accordingly be informed if any of these conditions are present: + Allergies. Anyone who has had adverse reactions to antihelminthic drugs should inform the prescribing physician before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be informed about any other pre-existing allergies. | No
6113 | ListItem | ¢ Ulcers. Antihelminthic drugs are also contraindicated for persons diagnosed with ulcers of the digestive tract, especially ulcerative colitis. | No
6114 | ListItem | « Pregnancy. There is research evidence reporting that some antihelminthic drugs cause birth defects or mis- carriage in animal studies. No human birth defects have been reported, but antihelminthic drugs are usually not recommended for use during pregnancy. Pregnant women should accordingly inform the prescribing physician. | No
6115 | ListItem | ¢ Breastfeeding. Some antihelminthic drugs can pass into breast milk. Breastfeeding may have to be discontinued until the antihelminthic treatment has ended and breast- feeding mothers must also inform the prescribing physician. | No
6116 | ListItem | ¢ Other risk conditions. Any of the following medical conditions should also be reported to the prescribing physician: Crohn’s disease, liver disease, kidney dis- ease and worm cysts in the eyes. | No
6117 | NarrativeText | Common side effects of antihelminthic drugs include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, sweating, dryness of the mouth and eyes, and ringing in the ears. Anyone taking these drugs should accordingly avoid driving, operating machines or other activities that may be dangerous until they know how they are affected by the drugs. Side effects usually wear off as the body adjusts to the drug and do not usually require medical treatment. Thiabendazole may cause the urine to have an unusual odor that can last for a day after the last dose. Other side effects of antihelminthic drugs, such as loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, vomit- ing, or abdominal cramps are less common. If they occur, they are usually mild and do not require medical attention. | No
6118 | NarrativeText | More serious side effects, such as fever, chills, con- fusion, extreme weakness, hallucinations, severe diar- rhea, nausea or vomiting, skin rashes, low back pain, dark urine, blurred vision, seizures, and jaundice have been reported in some cases. The patient’s physician should be informed immediately if any should develop. As a rule, anyone who has unusual symptoms after start- ing treatment with antihelminthic drugs should notify the prescribing physician. | No
6119 | NarrativeText | Antihelminthic drugs may interact with each other or with other drugs, whether prescribed or not. For exam- ple, it has been reported that use of the antihelminthic drugs pyrantel and piperazine together lowers the effi- ciency of pyrantel. Similarly, combining a given anti- helminthic drug with another medication may increase the risk of side effects from either drug. | No

6123 | NarrativeText | Antihemorrhoid drugs are medicines that reduce the swelling and relieve the discomfort of hemorrhoids (swellings in the area around the anus). | No
6124 | Title | Purpose | No
6125 | NarrativeText | Hemorrhoids are bulges in the veins that supply blood to the skin and membranes of the area around the anus. They may form for various reasons. Frequent heavy lifting, sitting for long periods, or straining to have bowel movements may put stress on anal tissues, which can lead to hemorrhoids. Some women develop hemorrhoids dur- ing pregnancy as the expanding uterus puts pressure on the anal tissues. The strain of labor and delivery can also cause hemorrhoids or make existing hemorrhoids worse. Hemorrhoids sometimes result from certain medical problems, such as tumors pressing on the lower bowel. | No
6126 | NarrativeText | The main symptoms of hemorrhoids are bleeding from the rectum, especially after a bowel movement, and itching, burning, pain, and general discomfort in the anal area. Over-the-counter antihemorrhoid products can relieve many of these symptoms. The products contain combinations of four main types of ingredients: «local anesthetics, such as benzocaine, lidocaine and tetracaine, to temporarily relieve the pain * vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine base, epinephrine hydrochloride, ephedrine sulfate and phenylephrine hydrochloride that reduce swelling and relieve itching and discomfort by tightening blood vessels | No
6127 | ListItem | *astringents (drying agents), such as witch hazel, calamine, and zinc oxide. These help shrink hemor- rhoids by pulling water out of the swollen tissue. This, in turn, helps relieve itching, burning, and irritation. | No

6148 | NarrativeText | Antihistamines are drugs that block the action of histamine (a compound released in allergic inflammatory reactions) at the H, receptor sites, responsible for imme- diate hypersensitivity reactions such as sneezing and itching. Members of this class of drugs may also be used for their side effects, including sedation and antiemesis (prevention of nausea and vomiting). | No
6149 | Title | DANELE BOVET (1907-1992) | No
6150 | NarrativeText | A gifted researcher in therapeutic chemistry, Daniele Bovet was born in Neuchatel, Switzerland, one of four children of a professor of experimental educa- tion. Bovet studied zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Geneva, receiving his doctor of sci- ence degree in 1929. He then joined the Pasteur Insti- tute in Paris, becoming director of the Laboratory of Therapeutic Chemistry in 1936. | No
6151 | NarrativeText | Bovet investigated histamine, thought to cause aller- gy symptoms. No antagonist of histamine was known, so Bovet—with his research student Anne-Marie Staub— began studying substances that blocked hormones simi- lar to histamine. By 1937 he had produced the first anti- histamine, thymoxydiethylamine. Since this substance was too toxic for human use, Bovet and Staub performed thousands more experiments seeking less toxic antihista- mines. This work formed the basis for the development of subsequent clinically useful antihistamines. | No
6152 | Title | Purpose | No
6153 | NarrativeText | Antihistamines provide their primary action by blocking histamine H, at the receptor site. They have no effect on rate of histamine release, nor do they inactivate histamine. By inhibiting the activity of histamine, they can reduce capillary fragility, which produces the erythe- ma, or redness, associated with allergic reactions. They will also reduce histamine-induced secretions, including excessive tears and salivation. Additional effects vary with the individual drug used. Several of the older drugs, called first-generation antihistamines, bind non-selec- tively to H, receptors in the central nervous system as well as to peripheral receptors, and can produce sedation, inhibition of nausea and vomiting, and reduction of motion sickness. The second-generation antihistamines bind only to peripheral H, receptors, and reduce allergic response with little or no sedation. | No
6154 | NarrativeText | The first-generation antihistamines may be divided into several chemical classes. The side effect profile, which also determines the uses of the drugs, will vary by chemical class. The alkylamines include brompheni- ramine (Dimetapp) and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trime- ton.) These agents cause relatively little sedation, and are used primarily for treatment of allergic reactions. Promet- hazine (Phenergan), in contrast, is a phenothiazine, chem- ically related to the major tranquilizers, and while it is used for treatment of allergies, may also be used as a sedative, the relieve anxiety prior to surgery, as an anti- nauseant, and for control of motion sickness.

6162 | NarrativeText | The second generation antihistamines have no cen- tral action, and are used only for treatment of allergic reactions. These are divided into two chemical classes. Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a piperazine derivative, and has a slight sedative effect. Loratidine (Claritin) and fexofena- dine (Allegra) are members of the piperadine class and are essentially non-sedating. | No
6163 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
6164 | NarrativeText | Dosage varies with drug, patient and intended use. Consult more detailed references for further information. | No
6165 | NarrativeText | When used for control of allergic reactions, antihista- mines should be taken on a regular schedule, rather than on an as-needed basis, since they have no effect on histamine itself, nor on histamine already bound to the receptor site. | No
6166 | NarrativeText | Efficacy is highly variable from patient to patient. If an antihistamine fails to provide adequate relief, switch to a drug from a different chemical class. Individual drugs may be effective in no more than 40% of patients, and provide 50% relief of allergic symptoms. | No

6197 | NarrativeText | The overall class of antihypertensive agents lowers blood pressure, although the mechanisms of action vary greatly. Within this therapeutic class, there are several subgroups. There are a very large number of drugs used to control hypertension, and the drugs listed below are rep- resentatives, but not the only members of their classes. | No
6198 | NarrativeText | The calcium channel blocking agents, also called slow channel blockers or calcium antagonists, inhibit the movement of ionic calcium across the cell membrane. This reduces the force of contraction of muscles of the heart and arteries. Although the calcium channel block- ers are treated as a group, there are four different chemi- cal classes, leading to significant variations in the activi- ty of individual drugs. Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) has the greatest effect on the blood vessels, while verapamil (Calan, Isoptin) and diltiazem (Cardizem) have a greater effect on the heart muscle itself. | No
6199 | NarrativeText | Peripheral vasodilators such as _ hydralazine (Apresoline), isoxuprine (Vasodilan), and minoxidil (Loniten) act by relaxing blood vessels. | No
6200 | NarrativeText | There are several groups of drugs which act by reduc- ing adrenergic nerve stimulation, the excitatory nerve stimulation that causes contraction of the muscles in the arteries, veins, and heart. These drugs include the beta- adrenergic blockers and alpha/beta adrenergic blockers. There are also non-specific adrenergic blocking agents. | No
6201 | NarrativeText | Beta-adrenergic blocking agents include propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and pindolol (Visken). Propranolol acts on the beta-adrenergic receptors any- where in the body, and has been used as a treatment for emotional anxiety and rapid heart beat. Atenolol and acebutolol (Sectral) act specifically on the nerves of the heart and circulation. | No
6202 | NarrativeText | There are two alpha/beta adrenergic blockers, labetolol (Normodyne, Trandate) and carvedilol (Coreg). These work similarly to the beta blockers. | No
6203 | NarrativeText | Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) act by inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, a substance that both induces constriction of blood vessels and retention of sodium, which leads to water retention and increased blood volume. There are 10 ACE inhibitors currently marketed in the United States, including captopril (Capoten), benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec), and quinapril (Acupril). The primary difference between these drugs is their onset and dura- tion of action. | No
6204 | NarrativeText | The ACE I inhibitors, losartan (Cozaar), candesar- tan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), telmisartan (Micardis), valsartan (Diovan) and eprosartan (Teveten) directly inhibit the effects of ACE II rather than blocking its production. Their actions are similar to the ACE inhibitors, but they appear to have a more favorable side effect and safety profile. | No
6205 | NarrativeText | In addition to these drugs, other classes of drugs have been used to lower blood pressure, most notably the thiazide diuretics. There are 12 thiazide diuretics mar- keted in the United States, including hydrochlorothiazide (Hydrodiuril, Esidrex), indapamide (Lozol), polythiazide (Renese), and hydroflumethiazide (Diucardin). The drugs in this class appear to lower blood pressure through several mechanisms. By promoting sodium loss they lower blood volume. At the same time, the pressure of the walls of blood vessels, the peripheral vascular resistance, is lowered. Thiazide diuretics are commonly used as the first choice for reduction of mild hyperten- sion, and may be used in combination with other antihy- pertensive drugs. | No

Patients must notify physicians if they have kidney prob- lems, since this might affect the type of drug adminis- tered. Patients must also notify their physician if they are allergic to any of the medications used to treat acute or long-term gout. Since all of these factors contribute to the disease, patients suffering from gout should attempt to lose weight, avoid excess alcohol consumption, and avoid foods high in purines, such as asparagus, sardines, lobster, avocado, and peas. | No

6236 | Title | Gout and hyperuricemia | No
6237 | NarrativeText | Persons with high levels of uric acid (hyper- uricemia) may experience gout. Commonly gout occurs in males in their 40s and 50s. Gout is defined by the attacks of (arthritic) painful, reddened joints, and is often accompanied by hard lumps in the painful joints. The most common joint affected is the big toe. Kidney stones, and/or poor kidney function may also be associ- ated with hyperuricemia, but may not be considered gout if the patient does not have painful joints. In persons with gout (and associated symptoms), uric acid forms crystals, which then cause the aforementioned symptoms. Although uric acid levels must be high in order for patients to have crystals form, and therefore have gout, most persons with high uric acid levels don’t ever have symptoms. Thus, recent criteria for use of anti-hyper- uricemic agents suggest that patients who have never experienced symptoms of gout should not receive drug therapy, unless their hyperuricemia is associated with cancer (may lead to kidney damage) or certain rare | No

6240 | Title | Acute gout attacks | No
6241 | NarrativeText | When patients experience acute attacks of gout, drugs that lower the levels of uric acid can cause an acute gout attack or cause an attack to become more severe. Thus, drugs that lower uric acid levels and are used to treat gout in the long term are not used in the short term. Medica- tions used in acute gout attacks include non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin), colchicine, and corticosteroids. Colchicine causes side effects in a large number of individuals (usually diarhhea). The most important factor in the effective treatment of gout may not be the drug used, but how quickly it is administered after an acute attack has begun. | No
6242 | Title | Long-term treatment | No
6243 | NarrativeText | Long-term treatment of gout or hyperuricemia usu- ally involves one of four drugs: allopurinol, probenicid, sulphinpyrazone, or benzbromarone (as of this printing in 2001, benzbromarone is not available for use in the United States). While allopurinol decreases the amount of uric acid that is produced (and may help prevent acute attacks of gout), the other drugs all increase the rate at which uric acid is excreted in the urine. As previously mentioned, lowering the concentration of uric acid can cause gout attacks. Thus, patients taking these medica- tions should have the dose slowly increased (and uric acid levels slowly lowered) to prevent acute attacks of gout. Patients may also be treated with colchicine or non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent acute attacks of gout (corticosteroids are not used in this sce- nario because over the long term corticosteroids have deleterious side effects). | No

These drugs should be used only for occasional treatment of tempo- rary sleep problems and should not be taken for more than a week or two at a time. People whose sleep problems last longer than this should see a physician. Their sleep prob- lems could be a sign of another medical problem. | No
6252 | Title | Description | No
6253 | NarrativeText | The anti-insomnia drug described here, zolpidem (Ambien), is a classified as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. CNS depressants are medicines that slow the nervous system. Physicians also prescribe medi- cines in the benzodiazepine family, such as flurazepam (Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), triazolam (Halcion), esta- zolam (ProSom), and temazepam (Restoril), for insom- nia. Benzodiazepine drugs are described in the essay on antianxiety drugs. Zaleplon (Sonata) is another anti- insomnia drug that is not related to other drugs with the same effect. The barbiturates, such as pentobarbital (Nembutal) and secobarbital (Seconal) are no longer commonly used to treat insomnia because they are too dangerous if they are taken in overdoses. For patients with mild insomnia, some antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax) may be used, since these also cause sleepiness. | No
6254 | NarrativeText | Zolpidem is available only with a physician’s pre- scription and comes in tablet form. | No
6255 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
6256 | NarrativeText | The recommended dose for adults is 5-10 mg just before bedtime. The medicine works quickly, often within 20 minutes, so it should be taken right before going to bed. | No
6257 | NarrativeText | For older people and others who may be more sensi- tive to the drug’s effects, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg just before bedtime. | No
6258 | NarrativeText | Never take more than 10 mg of zolpidem in one 24- hour period. Overdoses can lead to excessive sleepiness or coma. | No
6259 | NarrativeText | Zolpidem may be taken with food or on an empty stomach, but it may work faster when taken on an empty stomach. Check with a physician or pharmacists for instructions on how to take the medicine. | No
6260 | Title | Precautions | No
6261 | NarrativeText | Zolpidem is meant only for short-term treatment of insomnia. If sleep problems last more than seven to 10 days, check with a physician. Longer-lasting sleep prob- lems could be a sign of another medical problem. Also, this drug may lose its effectiveness when taken every night for more than a few weeks. | No

6263 | Table | Brand Name (Generic Name) Possible Common Side Effects Include: Ambien (zolpidem tartrate) Dalmane (flurazepam hydrochloride) Doral (quazepam) Halcion (triazolam) ProSom (estazolam) Restoril (temazepam) Daytime drowsiness, dizziness, headache Decreased coordination, lightheadedness, dizziness Daytime drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, fatigue Decreased coordination, chest pain, memory Dizziness, headache, nausea, weakness Dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headache, sluggishness Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, confused, light- headed, or less alert the morning after they have taken zolpidem. The medicine may also cause clumsiness, unsteadiness, double vision, or other vision problems the next day. For these reasons, anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else that might be dangerous until they have found out how zolpidem affects them. | No
6264 | NarrativeText | This medicine has caused cause behavior changes in some people, similar to those seen in people whose behavior changes when they drink alcohol. Examples include giddiness and rage. More extreme changes, such as confusion, agitation, and hallucinations, also are pos- sible. Anyone who starts having strange or unusual thoughts or behavior while taking this medicine should get in touch with his or her physician. | No
6265 | NarrativeText | Zolpidem and other sleep medicines may cause a special type of temporary memory loss, in which the per- son does not remember what happens between the time they take the medicine and the time its effects wear off. This is usually not a problem, because people go to sleep right after taking the medicine and stay asleep until its effects wear off. But it could be a problem for anyone who has to wake up before getting a full night’s sleep (seven to eight hours). In particular, travelers should not take this medicine on airplane flights of less than seven to eight hours. | No
6266 | NarrativeText | Because zolpidem works work on the central ner- vous system, it may add to the effects of alcohol and other drugs that slow down the central nervous system, such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. Zolpidem may also add to the effects of anesthetics, including those used for dental procedures. The combined effects of zolpidem and alco- hol or other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the central nervous system) can be very dangerous, leading to unconsciousness or even death. People who take zolpi- dem should not drink alcohol and should check with their physicians before taking any other CNS depressant. Any- one who shows signs of an overdose or of the effects of combining zolpidem drugs with alcohol or other drugs should have immediate emergency help. Warning signs include severe drowsiness, severe nausea or vomiting, breathing problems, and staggering. | No
6267 | NarrativeText | Anyone who takes zolpidem for more than one to two weeks should not stop taking it without first check- ing with a physician. Stopping the drug abruptly may cause rebound insomnia; increased difficulty falling asleep for the first one of two nights after the drug has been discontinued. In rare cases, withdrawal symptoms, such as vomiting, cramps, and unpleasant feelings may occur. Gradual tapering may be necessary. | No
6268 | NarrativeText | Older people may be more sensitive to the effects of zolpidem. This may increase the chance of side effects, such as confusion, and may also increase the risk of falling. | No
6269 | NarrativeText | In people with breathing problems, zolpidem may worsen the symptoms. | No
6270 | Title | Special conditions | No

6306 | NarrativeText | The medicine described here, hydroxyzine, is a type of antihistamine used to relieve itching caused by allergic reactions. An allergic reaction occurs when the body is unusually sensitive to some substance, such as pollen, dust, mold, or certain foods or medicine. The body reacts by releasing a chemical called histamine that causes itch- ing and other symptoms, such as sneezing and watery eyes. Antihistamines reduce the symptoms by blocking the effects of histamine. | No

6334 | NarrativeText | Antimalarial drugs are medicines that prevent or treat malaria. | No
6335 | Title | Purpose | No
6336 | NarrativeText | Antimalarial drugs treat or prevent malaria, a disease that occurs in tropical, subtropical, and some temperate regions of the world. The disease is caused by a parasite, Plasmodium, which belongs to a group of one-celled organisms known as protozoa. The only way to get malaria is to be bitten by a certain type of mosquito that has bitten someone who has the disease. Thanks to mos- quito control programs, malaria has been eliminated in the United States, almost all of Europe, and large parts of Central and South America. However, mosquito control has not worked well in other parts of the world, and malaria continues to be a major health problem in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and some Pacific Islands. Every year, some 30,000 Americans and Europeans who travel to these areas get malaria. People planning to travel to the tropics are often advised to take antimalarial drugs before, during, and after their trips, to help them avoid getting the disease and bringing it home with them. These drugs kill Plasmodium or prevent its growth. | No
6337 | NarrativeText | In recent years, some strains of Plasmodium have become resistant to antimalarial drugs, and medical researchers have stepped up efforts to develop a malaria vaccine. In early1997, researchers reported encouraging results from a small study of one vaccine and planned to test the vaccine in Africa. | No
6338 | Title | Description | No
6339 | NarrativeText | Antimalarial drugs are available only with a physi- cian’s prescription. They come in tablet, capsule, and injectable forms. Among the commonly used antimalari- al drugs are chloroquine (Aralen), mefloquine (Lariam), primaquine, pyrimethamine (Daraprim), and quinine. | No
6340 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
6341 | NarrativeText | Recommended dosage depends on the type of anti- malarial drug, its strength, and the form in which it is being used (such as tablet or injection). The dosage may also be different for different people. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage. Always take this medicine exactly as directed, and keep taking it for the full time of treatment. If the drug is being taken to treat malaria, do not stop taking it just because symptoms begin to improve. Symptoms may return if the drug is stopped too soon. Never take larger or more frequent doses than the physician has ordered, and do not take the drug for longer than directed. | No
6342 | NarrativeText | Travelers taking this medicine to prevent malaria may be told to take it for one to two weeks before their trip and for 4 weeks afterward, as well as for the whole time they are away. It is important to follow these directions. | No
6343 | NarrativeText | Antimalarial drugs work best when they are taken on a regular schedule. When taken once a week to prevent malaria, they should be taken on the same day every week. When taken daily or several times a day to treat malaria, they should be taken at the same time every day. Doses should not be missed or skipped. | No
6344 | NarrativeText | Some antimalarial drugs should be taken with meals or with milk to prevent upset stomach. Others must be taken with a full glass of water. Be sure to follow direc- tions for the best way to take the drug that is prescribed. | No

6347 | NarrativeText | The antimalarial drug mefloquine (Lariam) has received attention because of reports that it causes panic attacks, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, paranoia, and other mental and mood changes, sometimes lasting for months after the last dose. A study published in 1996 in the British Medical Journal noted that about one in 140 travelers who take the drug may have mental or mood changes severe enough to interfere with normal activities. This compares to about one in 1,100 patients who have such reactions to the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Any- one who has unexplained anxiety, depression, restless- ness, confusion, or other troubling mental or mood changes after taking mefloquine should call a physician right away. Switching to a different antimalarial drug may be an alternative and can allow the side effects to stop. | No
6348 | NarrativeText | Anyone taking antimalarial drugs to prevent malaria who develops a fever or flu-like symptoms while taking the medicine or within two to three months after travel- ing to an area where malaria is common should call a physician immediately. | No

6350 | NarrativeText | Patients who take this medicine over a long time need to have a physician check them periodically for unwanted side effects. | No
6351 | NarrativeText | Babies and children are especially sensitive to the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Not only are they more likely to have side effects from the medicine, but they are also at greater risk of being harmed by an overdose. A single 300-mg tablet could kill a small child. Keep this medicine out of the reach of children. Use safety vials. | No

6353 | NarrativeText | People with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take antimalarial drugs. Before taking these drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of these conditions: ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac- tions to antimalarial drugs or related medicines in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
6354 | NarrativeText | PREGNANCY. In laboratory animal studies, some antimalarial drugs cause birth defects. But it is also risky for a pregnant woman to get malaria. Untreated malaria can cause premature birth, stillbirth, and mis- carriage. When given in low doses to prevent malaria, antimalarial drugs have not been reported to cause birth defects in humans. If possible, pregnant women should avoid traveling to areas where they could get malaria. If travel is necessary, women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should check with their physicians about the use of antimalarial drugs. | No
6355 | NarrativeText | BREASTFEEDING. Some antimalarial drugs pass into breast milk. Although no problems have been reported in nursing babies whose mothers took antimalarial drugs, babies and young children are particularly sensitive to some of these drugs.

6409 | NarrativeText | Antimigraine drugs are medicines used to prevent or reduce the severity of migraine headaches. | No
6410 | Title | Purpose | No
6411 | NarrativeText | Migraine headaches usually cause a throbbing pain on one side of the head. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, increased sensitivity to light and sound, and other symp- toms may accompany the pain. The attacks may last for several hours or for a day or more and may come as often as several times a week. Some people who get migraine headaches have warning signals before the headaches begin, such as restlessness, tingling in an arm or leg, or seeing patterns of flashing lights. This set of signals is called an aura. The antimigraine drugs discussed in this section are meant to be taken as soon as the pain begins, to relieve the pain and other symptoms. Other types of drugs, such as antiseizure medicines, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers, are some- times prescribed to prevent attacks in people with very severe or frequent migraines. | No
6412 | Title | Description | No
6413 | NarrativeText | Migraine is thought to be caused by electrical and chemical imbalances in certain parts of the brain. These imbalances affect the blood vessels in the brain—first tightening them up, then widening them. As the blood ves- sels widen, they stimulate the release of chemicals that increase sensitivity to pain and cause inflammation and swelling. Antimigraine drugs are believed to work by cor- recting the imbalances and by tightening the blood vessels. | No
6414 | NarrativeText | Examples of drugs in this group are ergotamine (Cafergot), naratriptan (Amerge), sumatriptan (Imitrex), rizatriptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig). Methy- sergide maleate (Sansert) may be used by patients whose headaches are not controlled by other drugs, while some patients do well on other drugs. For example, combina- tions or ergotamine and caffeine may be very effective. The caffeine acts by constricting blood vessels to relieve the headache. Sometimes, an analgesic such as aceta- minophen, caffeine, and a barbiturate which acts as a sedative, are combined, as in Fioricet and similar com- pounds. These medicines are available only with a physi- cian’s prescription and come in several forms. Ergota- mine is available as tablets and rectal suppositories; sumatriptan as tablets, injections, and nasal spray; and zolmitriptan as tablets. | No

6487 | NarrativeText | Testing for antimyocardial antibodies is done when evaluating a person for heart damage or heart disease. | No
6488 | Title | Purpose | No
6489 | NarrativeText | Antimyocardial antibodies are autoantibodies. Nor- mal antibodies are special proteins built by the body as a defense against foreign material entering the body. Autoantibodies are also proteins built by the body, but instead of attacking foreign material, they inappropriate- ly attack the body’s own cells. Antimyocardial antibodies attack a person’s heart muscle, or myocardium. | No
6490 | NarrativeText | This test may be done on a person who recently had trauma to the heart, such as heart surgery or a myocardial infarction (heart attack). It also may be done on some- one with heart disease, such as cardiomyopathy or rheumatic fever. | No
6491 | NarrativeText | Although the presence of antimyocardial antibodies does not diagnose heart damage or disease, there is a connection between the presence of these antibodies and damage to the heart. The amount of damage, however, cannot be predicted by the amount of antibodies. | No
6492 | Title | 291 | No
6493 | NarrativeText | These antibodies usually appear after heart surgery or the beginning of disease, but they may be present before surgery or the onset of disease. In 30% of people with myocardial infarction and 70% of people having heart surgery, antimyocardial antibodies will appear with- in two to three weeks and stay for three to eight weeks. | No
6494 | Title | Description | No
6495 | NarrativeText | A 5-10 mL sample of venous blood is drawn from the patient’s arm in the region of the inner elbow. Antimyocar- dial antibodies are detected by combining a patient’s serum (clear, thin, sticky fluid in blood) with cells from animal heart tissue, usually that of a monkey. Antimyocar- dial antibodies in the serum bind to the heart tissue cells. A fluorescent dye is then added to the mixture. This dye will attach to any antibodies and heart tissue cells bound together. The final mixture is studied under a microscope that is designed to show fluorescence. If fluorescent cells are seen under the microscope, the test is positive. | No
6496 | NarrativeText | When the test is positive, the next step is to find out how much antibody is present. The patient’s serum is diluted, or titered, and the test is done again. The serum is then further diluted and the test repeated until the serum is so dilute that fluorescence is no longer seen. The last dilu- tion that showed fluorescence is the titer reported. | No
6497 | Title | Preparation | No
6498 | NarrativeText | No fasting or special prepartion is needed. Before the test is done it should be explained to the patient. | No
6499 | Title | Aftercare | No
6500 | NarrativeText | Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site after the blood is drawn or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Warm packs on the puncture site relieve discomfort. | No

6502 | NarrativeText | Antimyocardial antibodies are not normally seen in healthy individuals. | No
6503 | Title | Abnormal results | No
6504 | NarrativeText | A positive result means that antimyocardial antibod- ies are present and that heart disease or damage is likely. Further testing may be needed as other autoantibodies could also be present, causing a false abnormal test. | No

6556 | NarrativeText | The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a test done early in the evaluation of a person for autoimmune or rheumatic disease, particularly systemic lupus erythe- matosus (SLE). | No
6557 | Title | Purpose | No

6560 | NarrativeText | these antibodies. Autoantibodies are proteins built by the body, but instead of guarding against foreign material (including bacteria, viruses, and fungi) as normal anti- bodies do, they attack the body’s own cells. | No
6561 | NarrativeText | Autoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be difficult to diagnose. People with the same disease can have very different symptoms. A helpful strategy in the diagnosis of these diseases is to find and identify an autoantibody in the person’s blood. | No
6562 | NarrativeText | The antinuclear antibody test looks for a group of autoantibodies that attack substances found in the center (nucleus) of all cells. It is useful as a screen for many autoantibodies associated with diseases that affect the entire body (systemic diseases). | No
6563 | NarrativeText | This test is particularly useful when diagnosing a person with symptoms of SLE, an illness that affects many body organs and tissues. If the test is negative, it is unlikely that the person has SLE; if the test is positive, more tests are done to confirm whether the person has SLE or another related disease. Other diseases, such as scleroderma, Sjégren’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune hepatitis, often have a positive test for antinuclear antibodies. | No
6564 | Title | Description | No
6565 | NarrativeText | Five to 10 mL of blood is needed for this test. The antinuclear antibody test is done by adding a person’s serum to commercial cells mounted on a microscope slide. If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum, they bind to the nuclei of cells on the slide. Next, a second anti- body is added to the mixture. This antibody is “tagged” with a fluorescent dye so that it can be seen. The second antibody attaches to any antibodies and cells bound together and, because of the fluorescent “tag,” the areas with antinuclear antibodies seem to glow, or fluoresce, when the slide is viewed under an ultraviolet microscope. | No
6566 | NarrativeText | If fluorescent cells are seen, the test is positive. When positive, the serum is diluted, or titered, and the test done again. These steps are repeated until the serum is so dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The last dilution that shows fluorescence is the titer reported. | No
6567 | NarrativeText | The pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives the physician clues as to what the disease might be. The test result includes the titer and the pattern. | No

6595 | Title | Purpose | No
6596 | NarrativeText | Antiparkinson drugs are used to treat symptoms of parkinsonism, a group of disorders that share four main symptoms: tremor or trembling in the hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face; stiffness or rigidity of the arms, legs, and trunk; slowness of movement (bradykinesia); and poor balance and coordination. Parkinson’s disease is the most common form of parkinsonism and is seen more fre- quently with advancing age. Other forms of the disorder may result from viral infections, environmental toxins, carbon monoxide poisoning, and the effects of treat- ment with antipsychotic drugs. | No
6597 | NarrativeText | The immediate cause of Parkinson’s disease or Parkinsonian-like syndrome is the lack of the neurotrans- mitter dopamine in the brain. Drug therapy may take sev- eral forms, including replacement of dopamine, inhibition of dopamine metabolism to increase the effects of the dopamine already present, or sensitization of dopamine receptors. Drugs may be used singly or in combination. | No

6601 | Table | Antiparkinson Drugs Brand Name (Generic Name) Possible Common Side Effects Include: Artane (trinexyphenidyl hydrochloride) Benadryl (diephenhydramine hydrochloride) Cogentin (benztropine mesylate) Eldepryl (selegiline hydrochloride) Parlodel (bromocriptine mesylate) Sinemet CR Dry mouth, nervousness, blurred vision, nausea Dizziness, sleepiness, upset stomach, decreased coordination Constipation, dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, rash Abdominal and back pain, drowsiness, decreased coordination Constipation, decreased blood pressure, abdominal cramps Involuntary body movements, confusion, nausea, hallucinations inhibits the enzyme responsible for the destruction of lev- odopa. The limitation of levodopa or levodopa-carbidopa therapy is that after approximately two years of treatment, the drugs cease to work reliably. This has been termed the “on-off phenomenon.” Additional treatment strategies have been developed to retard the progression of Parkin- sonism, or to find alternative approaches to treatment. | No
6602 | NarrativeText | Anticholinergic drugs reduce some of the symptoms of Parkinsonism, and reduce the reuptake of dopamine, thereby sustaining the activity of the natural neurohor- mone. They may be effective in all stages of the disease. All drugs with anticholinergic properties, the naturally occurring belladonna alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine, hyoscyamine), some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties, and synthetics such as benztropin (Cogentin), procyclidine (Kemadrin) and biperiden (Akineton) are members of this group. Although the anticholinergic drugs have only limited activity against Parkinson’s dis- ease, they are useful in the early stages, and may be adjuncts to levodopa as the disease progresses. | No
6603 | NarrativeText | Selegeline (Carbex, Eldepryl) is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, however its mechanism of action in Parkinsonism is unclear, since other drugs with MAO-B inhibition have failed to show similar anti-Parkinsonian effects. Selegeline is used pri- marily as an adjunct to levodopa, although some studies have indicated that the drug may be useful in the early stages of Parkinsonism, and may delay the progression of the disease. | No
6604 | NarrativeText | Pramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip) are believed to act by direct stimulation of the dopamine recep- tors in the brain. They may be used alone in early Parkison’s disease, or as adjuncts to levodopa in advanced stages. | No

6610 | NarrativeText | Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is a prolactin inhibitor, which is used for a variety of indications including amenorrhea/galactorrhea, female infertility, and acromegaly. It appears to work by direct stimulation of the dopamine receptors. Bromocriptine is used as a late adjunct to levodopa therapy, and may permit reduction in levodopa dosage. Pergolide (Permax) is similar to bromocriptine, but has not been studied as extensively in Parkinson’s disease. | No
6611 | NarrativeText | Entacapone (Comtan) appears to act by maintaining levels of dopamine through enzyme inhibition. It is used as an adjunct to levodopa was the patient is beginning to experience the on-off effect. Tolcapone (Tasmar) is a similar agent, but has demonstrated the potential for inducing severe liver failure. As such, tolcapone is reserved for cases where all other adjunctive therapies have failed or are contraindicated. | No
6612 | NarrativeText | The anticholinergics have a large number of adverse effects, all related to their primary mode of activity. Their cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, palpitations, hypotension, postural hypotension, and mild bradycar- dia. They may also cause a wide range of central nervous system effects, including disorientation, confusion, memory loss, hallucinations, psychoses, agitation, ner- vousness, delusions, delirium, paranoia, euphoria, excitement, lightheadedness, dizziness, headache, list- lessness, depression, drowsiness, weakness, and giddi- ness. Dry mouth, dry eyes and gastrointestinal distress are common problems. Sedation has been reported with some drugs in this group, but this may be beneficial in patients who suffer from insomnia. Pregnancy risk fac- tor is C. Because anticholinergic drugs may inhibit milk production, their use during breastfeeding is not recom- mended. Patients should be warned that anticholinergic | No

Symptoms of gastrointestinal upset, such as nausea and vomiting, have been reported in 80% of cases. Other reported effects include increased hand tremor; headache; dizziness; numbness; weakness and faintness; bruxism; confusion; insomnia; nightmares; hallucinations and delusions; agitation and anxiety; malaise; fatigue and euphoria. Levodopa has not been list- ed under the pregnancy risk factor schedules, but should be used with caution. Breastfeeding is not recommended. | No
6632 | NarrativeText | Pramipexole and ropinirole cause orthostatic hypotension, hallucinations and dizziness. The two drugs are in pregnancy category C. In animals, ropinirole has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo-fetal development, including teratogenic effects, decreased fetal body weight, increased fetal death and digital mal- formation. Because these drugs inhibit prolactin secre- tion, they should not be taken while breastfeeding. | No
6633 | Title | Side effects | No
6634 | NarrativeText | Amantadine is generally well tolerated, but may cause dizziness and nausea. It is classified as pregnancy schedule C. Since amantadine is excreted in breast milk, breastfeed- ing while taking amantidine is not recommended. | No

6705 | NarrativeText | Psychosis is defined as “a serious mental disorder (as schizophrenia) characterized by defective or lost contact with reality often with hallucinations or delu- sions.” Psychosis is an end-stage condition arising from a variety of possible causes. Anti-psychotic drugs control the symptoms of psychosis, and in many cases are effec- tive in controlling the symptoms of other disorders that may lead to psychosis, including bipolar mood disorder (formerly termed manic-depressive), in which the patient cycles from severe depression to feelings of extreme excitation. This class of drugs is primarily composed of the major tranquilizers; however, lithium carbonate, a drug that is largely specific to bipolar mood disorder, is commonly classified among the antipsychotic agents. | No
6706 | Title | Description | No
6707 | NarrativeText | The antipsychotic agents may be divided by chemi- cal class. The phenothiazines are the oldest group, and include chlorpromazine (Thorazine), mesoridazine (Ser- entil), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and thioridazine (Mellaril). These drugs are essentially similar in action and adverse effects. They may also be used as anti-emet- ics, although prochlorperazine is the drug most often used for this indication. | No
6708 | NarrativeText | The phenylbutylpiperadines are haloperidol (Haldol) and pimozide (Orap). They find primary use in control of Tourette’s syndrome. Haloperidol has been extremely useful in controlling aggressive behavior. | No
6709 | NarrativeText | The debenzapine derivatives, clozapine (Clozaril), loxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiap- ine (Seroquel), have been effective in controlling psy- chotic symptoms that have not been responsive to other classes of drugs. | No
6710 | NarrativeText | The benzisoxidil group is composed of resperidone (Resperidal) and ziprasidone (Geodon). Resperidone has been found useful for controlling bipolar mood disorder, while ziprasidone is used primarily as second-line treat- ment for schizophrenia. | No
6711 | Title | 300 | No
6712 | NarrativeText | In addition to these drugs, the class of antipsychotic agents includes lithium carbonate (Eskalith, Lithonate), which is used for control of bipolar mood disorder, and thiothixene (Navane), which is used in the treatment of psychosis. | No

6716 | NarrativeText | Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a rare, idiosyncratic combination of extra-pyramidal symp- toms (EPS), hyperthermia, and autonomic disturbance. Onset may be hours to months after drug initiation, but once started, proceeds rapidly over 24 to 72 hours. It is most commonly associated with haloperidol, long-acting fluphenazine, but has occurred with thiothixene, thiori- dazine, and clozapine, and may occur with other agents. NMS is potentially fatal, and requires intensive sympto- matic treatment and immediate discontinuation of neu- roleptic treatment. There is no established treatment. Most patients who develop NMS will have the same problem if the drug is restarted. | No
6717 | NarrativeText | Tardive dyskinesia (TD). Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome of involuntary movements that may appear in patients treated with neuroleptic drugs. Although preva- lence of TD appears highest among the elderly, especial- ly women, it is impossible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Both the risk of develop- ing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are increased with higher doses and longer periods of treatment. The syndrome can develop after short treat- ment periods at low doses. Anticholinergic agents may worsen these effects. Clozapine has occasionally been useful in controlling the TD caused by other antipsychot- ic drugs. | No
6718 | NarrativeText | Agranulocytosis has been associated with clozapine. This is a potentially fatal reaction, but can be prevented with careful monitoring of the white blood count. There are no well-established risk factors for developing agran- ulocytosis, and so all patients treated with this drug must follow the clozapine Patient Management System.

The “conventional” antipsychotic drugs are classified by their chemical structures as the phenothiazines, thioxanthines (which are chemically very similar to the phenothiazines), butyrophenones, diphenylbutylpiperadines and the indolones. All of the atypical antipsychotic agents are chemically classified as dibenzepines. They are considered atypical or novel because they have different side effects from the conven- tional antipsychotic agents. The atypical drugs are far less likely to cause extra-pyrammidal side-effects(EPS), drug induced involuntary movements, than are the older drugs.

6744 | NarrativeText | Although the atypical antipsychotics are generally safe, clozapine has been associated with severe agranulo- cytosis, a shortage of white blood cells. For this reason, people who may be treated with clozapine should have blood counts before starting the drug, blood counts every week for as long as they are using clozapine, and blood counts every week for the first four weeks after they stop taking clozapine. If there is any evidence of a drop in the white blood count while using clozapine, the drug should be stopped. | No

6783 | Title | Purpose | No
6784 | NarrativeText | Antiretroviral agents are virustatic agents which block steps in the replication of the virus. The drugs are not curative; however continued use of drugs, particular- ly in multi-drug regimens, significantly slows disease progression. | No
6785 | Title | Description | No
6786 | NarrativeText | There are three main types of antiretroviral drugs, although only two steps in the viral replications process are blocked. Nucleoside analogs, or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as didanosine (ddI, Videx), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), stavudine (d4T, Zerit), zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), and zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir), act by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Because a retrovirus is composed of RNA, the virus must make a DNA strand in order to replicate itself. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that is essential to making the DNA copy. The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are incorporated into the DNA strand. This is a faulty DNA molecule which is incapable of reproducing. | No
6787 | NarrativeText | The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase in- hibitors (NNRTIs), such as delavirdine (Rescriptor), loviride, and nevirapine (Viramune) act by binding directly to the reverse transcriptase molecule, inhibiting its activity. | No
6788 | NarrativeText | Protease inhibitors, such as indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir), and saquinavir (Invirase) act on the enzyme protease, which is essential for the virus to break down the proteins in infected cells. Without this essential step, the virus produces immature copies of itself, which are non-infectious. | No
6789 | NarrativeText | Because HIV mutates readily, the virus can develop resistance to single drug therapy. However, treatment with drug combinations appears to produce a durable response. Proper treatment appears to slow the progres- sion of HIV infections and reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections. | No
6790 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
6791 | NarrativeText | Doses must be individualized based on the patient, and use of interacting drugs. The optimum combinations of antiretroviral drugs have not been determined, nor is there agreement on the stage of infection at which to start treatment. | No
6792 | Title | Precautions | No
6793 | NarrativeText | Although the antiretroviral drugs fall into three groups, each drug has a unique pattern of adverse effects and drug interactions. Since the drugs are used in various combinations, the frequency and severity of adverse effects will vary with the combination. Although most drug combinations show a higher rate of adverse events that single drug therapy, some patterns are not pre- dictable. For example, indinavir has been reported to cause insomnia in 3% of patients, however, when used in combination with zidovudine, only 1.5% of patients complained of sleep difficulties. | No
6794 | NarrativeText | The most severe adverse effects associated with the protease inhibitors are renal and hepatic toxicity. Patients have also reported a syndrome of abdominal distention | No

The drugs are pregnancy category B. There have been no con- trolled studies of safety in pregnancy. HIV-infected mothers are advised not to breast feed in order to prevent transmission of the virus to the newborn. | No
6808 | NarrativeText | Because of the high risk of viral resistance develop- ment, antiretroviral agents should be used in combina- tion. If one drug in the group must be discontinued, it is recommended that all antiretroviral therapy be discontin- ued until a multi-drug regimen can be resumed. The non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors particularly should not be used alone. | No
6809 | NarrativeText | The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have significant levels of toxicity. Lactic acidosis in the absence of hypoxemia and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis have been reported with zidovudine and zal- citabine, and are potentially fatal.

6829 | NarrativeText | Antirheumatic drugs are drugs used to treat rheuma- toid arthritis. | No
6830 | Title | Purpose | No
6831 | NarrativeText | Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive form of arthritis that has devastating effects on joints and general health. It is classified as an auto-immune disease, because the dis- ease is caused by the body’s own immune system acting against the body itself. Symptoms include painful, stiff, swollen joints, fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite. | No
6832 | NarrativeText | In recent years, there has been a change in attitude concerning the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Physi- cians now use Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) early in the history of the disease and are less inclined to wait for crippling stages before resorting to the more potent drugs. Fuller understanding of the side-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has also stimulated reliance on other types of antirheumatic drugs. | No
6833 | Title | Description | No
6834 | NarrativeText | The major classes of antirheumatic drugs include: ¢ Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs. Drugs belonging to this class bring symptomatic relief of both inflammation and pain, but have a limited effect on the progressive bone and cartilage loss associated with rheumatoid arthritis. They act by slowing the body’s production of prostaglandins. Common NSAIDs include: ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin or Advil), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve) and indomethacin(Indocin). | No
6835 | ListItem | Corticosteroids. These drugs are very powerful anti- inflammatory agents. They are the synthetic analogs of cortisone, produced by the body. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and suppress activity of the immune system. The most commonly prescribed are prednisone and dexamethasone. | No
6836 | ListItem | Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). DMARDs influence the disease process itself and do not only treat symptoms, hence their name. DMARDs also have anti-inflammatory effects, and most were borrowed from the treatment of other diseases, such as cancer and malaria. Antimalarials DMARDs include chloroquine (Aralen) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). Powerful DMARDs include: methotrexate (Rheumatrex), sul- fasalazine, cyclosporine, azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azathioprine, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, and organic gold compounds such as aurothioglucose (Solganol), gold sodium thiomalate (Aurolate) and auranofin (Ridaura). | No
6837 | ListItem | Slow-Acting Antirheumatic Drugs (SAARDs). SAARDs are a special class of DMARDs and the effect of these drugs is slow acting and not so quickly apparent as that of the NSAIDs. Examples are hydroxychloroquine and aurothioglucose. | No
6838 | ListItem | Immunosuppresive cytotoxic drugs. This class of drugs is used if treatment with NSAIDs and SAARDs have no effect. Immunosuppresive drugs have a stabilizing effect on the immune system. Since the inflammation associated with chronic arthritis is due to malfunctions of the immune system, use of this class of drugs has been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as well. Examples are: methotrex- ate, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambu- cil, and azathioprine. | No

6881 | NarrativeText | An antiseptic is a substance which inhibits the growth and development of microorganisms. For practi- cal purposes, antiseptics are routinely thought of as topi- cal agents, for application to skin, mucous membranes, and inanimate objects, although a formal definition includes agents which are used internally, such as the uri- nary tract antiseptics. | No
6882 | Title | Purpose | No
6883 | NarrativeText | Antiseptics are a diverse class of drugs which are applied to skin surfaces or mucous membranes for their anti-infective effects. This may be either bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic. Their uses include cleansing of skin and wound surfaces after injury, preparation of skin surfaces prior to injections or surgical procedures, and routine disin- fection of the oral cavity as part of a program of oral hygiene. Antiseptics are also used for disinfection of inani- mate objects, including instruments and furniture surfaces. | No
6884 | NarrativeText | Commonly used antiseptics for skin cleaning include benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophine, iodine compounds, mercury compounds, alcohol and hydrogen peroxide. Other agents which have been used for this purpose, but have largely been supplanted by more effective or safer agents, include boric acid and volatile oils such as methy]1 salicylate (oil of wintergreen.) | No
6885 | NarrativeText | Chlorhexidine shows a high margin of safety when applied to mucous membranes, and has been used in oral rinses and preoperative total body washes. | No
6886 | NarrativeText | Benzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophine are used primarily as hand scrubs or face washes. Benzalkonium may also find application is a disinfecting agent for instruments, and in low concentration as a preservative for drugs includ- ing ophthalmic solutions. Benzalkonium chloride is inacti- vated by organic compounds, including soap, and must not be applied to areas which have not been fully rinsed. | No
6887 | NarrativeText | Iodine compounds include tincture of iodine and povidone iodine compounds. Iodine compounds have the broadest spectrum of all topical anti-infectives, with action against bacteria, fungi, viruses, spores, protozoa, and yeasts. Iodine tincture is highly effective, but its alcoholic component is drying and extremely irritating when applied to abraided (scraped or rubbed) skin. Povidone iodine, an organic compound, is less irritating and less toxic, but not as effective. Povidone iodine has been used for hand scrubs and disinfection of surgical sites. Aqueous solu- tions of iodine have also been used as antiseptic agents, but are less effective than alcoholic solutions and less con- venient to use that the povidone iodine compounds. | No
6888 | NarrativeText | Hydrogen peroxide acts through the liberation of oxygen gas. Although the antibacterial activity of hydro- gen peroxide is relatively weak, the liberation of oxygen bubbles produces an effervescent action, which may be useful for wound cleansing through removal of tissue debris.

6916 | NarrativeText | Most of the drugs used for this purpose as “anti- cholinergics”, since they counteract the effects of the neurohormone acetylcholine. Some of these drugs are derived from the plant belladonna, also known as Deadly Nightshade. There is also a group of drugs with similar activity, but not taken from plant sources. The anti- cholingergics decrease both the movements of the stom- ach and intestine, and also the secretions of stomach acid and digestive enzymes. They may be used for other pur- poses including treatment of Parkinson’s Disease, and bladder urgency. Because these drugs inhibit secretions, they cause dry mouth and dry eyes because of reduced salivation and tearing. Dicyclomine is an antispasmodic with very lettle effect on secretions. It is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. | No

6922 | Title | Precautions | No
6923 | NarrativeText | Dicyclomine makes some people sweat less, which allows the body to overheat and may lead to heat prostra- tion (fever and heat stroke). Anyone taking this drug should try to avoid extreme heat. If that is not possible, check with the physician who prescribed the drug. If heat prostration occurs, stop taking the medicine and call a physician immediately. | No

6954 | NarrativeText | Antituberculosis drugs are medicines used to treat tuberculosis, an infectious disease that can affect the lungs and other organs. | No
6955 | Title | Purpose | No
6956 | NarrativeText | Tuberculosis is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculae, a bacteria that is passed between people through the air. The disease can be cured with proper drug therapy, but because the bacteria may become resis- tant to any single drug, combinations of antituberculosis drugs are used to treat tuberculosis (TB) are normally required for effective treatment. At the start of the 20th Century, tuberculosis was the most common cause of death in the United States, but was laregly eliminated with better living conditions. It is most common in areas of crowding and poor ventilation, suich as crowded urban areas and prisons. In some areas, the AIDS epi- demic has been accompanied by an increase in the preva- lence of tuberculosis. | No
6957 | NarrativeText | Some antituberculosis drugs also are used to treat or prevent other infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), which causes disease throughout the bodies of people with AIDS or other diseases of the immune system. | No
6958 | Title | Description | No
6959 | NarrativeText | Antituberculosis drugs are available only with a physician’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liq- uid and injectable forms. Some commonly used antitu- berculosis drugs are cycloserine (Seromycin), ethambu- tol (Myambutol), ethionamide (Trecator-SC), isoniazid (Nydrazid, Laniazid), pyrazinamide, —_ rifabutin (Mycobutin), and rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane). | No
6960 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
6961 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of antituberculosis drug and may be different for different patients. Check with the physician who prescribed the medicine or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the proper dosage. The physician may gradually increase the dosage during treatment. Be sure to follow the physician’s orders. Patients who are infected with HIV must usually take larger combinations of drugs for a longer period of time than is needed for patients with an unimpaired immune system. | No
6962 | NarrativeText | Some antituberculosis drugs must be taken with other drugs. If they are taken alone, they may encourage the bacteria that cause tuberculosis to become resistant to drugs used to treat the disease. When the bacteria become resistant, treating the disease becomes more difficult. | No
6963 | NarrativeText | To clear up tuberculosis completely, antituberculosis drugs must be taken for as long as directed. This may mean taking the medicine every day for a year or two or even longer. Symptoms may improve very quickly after | No
6964 | Title | 310 | No
6965 | NarrativeText | treatment with this medicine begins. However, they may come back if the medicine is stopped too quickly. Do not stop taking the medicine just because symptoms improve. | No
6966 | NarrativeText | Because people may neglect to take their medication for tuberculosis, it is common to have tuberculosis centers develop a program of Directly Observed Therapy (DOT.) In these programs, patients come to the hospital or clinic, and take their medication in front of an observer. These programs may be annoying to the patients, but are justi- fied by the risks to public health if tuberculosis germs which have become resistant to drugs were to be spread. | No
6967 | NarrativeText | Cycloserine works best when it is at constant levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take the medi- cine in doses spaced evenly through the day and night. Do not miss any doses. If taking medicine at night inter- feres with sleep, or if it is difficult to remember to take the medicine during the day, check with a health care professional for suggestions. | No
6968 | NarrativeText | Do not take antacids that contain aluminum, such as Maalox, within | hour of taking isoniazid, as this may keep the medicine from working. | No
6969 | Title | Precautions | No
6970 | NarrativeText | Seeing a physician regularly while taking antituber- culosis drugs is important. The physician will check to make sure the medicine is working as it should and will watch for unwanted side effects. These visits also will help the physician know if the dosage needs to be changed. | No
6971 | NarrativeText | Symptoms should begin to improve within a few weeks after treatment begins with antituberculosis drugs. If they do not, or if they become worse, check with a physician. | No
6972 | NarrativeText | Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, confused, or less alert when using these drugs. Some may also cause vision changes, clumsiness, or unsteadiness. Because of these possible problems, anyone who takes antitubercu- losis drugs should not drive, use machines, or do any- thing else that might be dangerous until they have found out how the medicine affects them. | No
6973 | NarrativeText | Daily doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B,) may lessen or prevent some side effects of ethionamide or isoniazid. If the physician who prescribed the medicine recom- mends this, be sure to take the pyridoxine every day. | No
6974 | NarrativeText | Certain kinds of cheese (such as Swiss and Cheshire) and fish (such as tuna and skipjack) may cause an unusual reaction in people taking isoniazid. Symptoms of this reaction include fast or pounding heartbeat, sweating or a hot feeling, chills or a clammy feeling, headache, light- headedness, and red or itchy skin. This reaction is very rare. However, if any of these symptoms occur, check with a physician as soon as possible. | No
6975 | NarrativeText | Rifabutin and rifampin will make saliva, sweat, tears, urine, feces, and skin turn reddish orange to reddish brown. This is nothing to worry about. However, the discolored tears may permanently stain soft contact lenses (but not hard contact lenses). To avoid ruining contact lenses, do not wear soft contacts while taking these medicines. | No
6976 | NarrativeText | Rifampin may temporarily lower the number of white blood cells. Because the white blood cells are important in fighting infection, this effect increases the chance of getting an infection. This drug also may lower the number of platelets that play an important role in clotting. To reduce the risk of bleeding and infection in the mouth while taking this medicine, be especially care- ful when brushing and flossing the teeth. Check with a physician or dentist for suggestions on how to keep the teeth and mouth clean without causing injuries. Put off any dental work until blood counts return to normal. | No
6977 | NarrativeText | Rifampin may affect the results of some medical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care professional in charge. | No
6978 | NarrativeText | People who have certain medical conditions may have problems if they take antituberculosis drugs. For example: *cycloserine or isoniazid may increase the risk of seizures (convulsions) in people with a history of seizures. | No

6986 | ListItem | + side effects are also more likely in people with liver dis- ease who take pyrazinamide. | No
6987 | NarrativeText | Before taking antituberculosis drugs, be sure to let the physician know about these or any other medical problems. | No
6988 | NarrativeText | In laboratory tests of pregnant animals, high doses of some antituberculosis drugs have caused birth defects and other problems in the fetus or newborn. However, pregnant women with tuberculosis need to take antituber- culosis drugs to clear up their disease. Knowing that many women have had healthy babies after taking these drugs during pregnancy may be reassuring. Pregnant women who need to take this medicine and are worried about birth defects or other problems should talk to their physicians. | No
6989 | NarrativeText | Anyone who has had unusual reactions to antituber- culosis drugs or to niacin should let his or her physician know before taking any antituberculosis drug. The physi- cian should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
6990 | NarrativeText | Patients who are on special diets, such as low-sodi- um or low-sugar diets, should make sure their physicians know. Some antituberculosis medicines may contain sodium, sugar, or alcohol. | No

If any of these symptoms occur, check with a physician immediately. Other side effects that should be brought to a physician’s attention immedi- ately include yellow eyes or skin and mood or mental changes such as depression or confusion. | No
7003 | NarrativeText | Less serious side effects such as dizziness, nausea or vomiting, appetite loss, sore mouth, or metallic taste may also occur. These problems usually go away as the body adjusts to the medicine. They do not need medical atten- tion unless they continue or they interfere with normal activities. | No

7052 | NarrativeText | Recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori infections, and are treated with com- bination treatments that incorporate antibiotic therapy with gastric acid suppression. Additionally, bismuth compounds have been used. The primary class of drugs used for gastric acid suppression are the proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole. The H-2 receptor blocking agents, cimeti- dine, famotidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine have been used for this purpose, but are now more widely used for mainte- nance therapy after treatment with the proton pump inhibitors. Sucralfate, which acts by forming a protective coating over the ulcerate lesion, is also used in ulcer treat- ment and may be appropriate for patients in whom other classes of drugs are not indicated, or those whose gastric ulcers are caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rather than H. pylori infections. | No

In some cases, gas- tric acid secretion is completely blocked for over 24 hours on a single dose. In addition to their role in treatment of gastric ulcers, the proton pump inhibitors are used to treat syndromes of excessive acid secretion (Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). | No
7055 | NarrativeText | Histamine H-2 receptor blockers stop the action of histamine on the gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secre- tion of gastric acid. These drugs are less effective than the proton pump inhibitors, but may achieve a 75-79% reduc- tion in acid secretion. Higher rates of acid inhibition may be achieved when the drug is administered by the intra- venous route. The H-2 receptor blockers may also be used to treat heartburn and hypersecretory syndromes. When given before surgery, the H-2 receptor blockers are useful in prevention of aspiration pneumonia. | No
7056 | NarrativeText | itching, skin rash, dizziness and headache. Muscle aches and a higher than normal rate of respiratory infec- tions are among the other adverse reactions reported. Omeprazole has an increased rate of fetal deaths in ani- mal studies. It is not known if these drugs are excreted in human milk, but because of reported adverse effects to infants in animal studies, it is recommended that proton pump inhibitors not be used by nursing mothers. | No
7057 | NarrativeText | The H-2 receptor blockers vary widely in their adverse effects. Although they are generally well tolerat- ed, cimetidine may cause confusion in elderly patients, and has an antiandrogenic effect that may cause sexual dysfunction in males. Famotidine has been reported to cause headache in 4.7% of patients. It is advisable that mothers not take H-2 receptor blockers while nursing. | No
7058 | NarrativeText | Sucralfate (Carafate), a substituted sugar molecule with no nutritional value, does not inhibit gastric acid, but rather, reacts with existing stomach acid to form a thick coating that covers the surface of an ulcer, protecting the open area from further damage. A secondary effect is to act as an inhibitor of the digestive enzyme pepsin. Sucral- fate does not bind to the normal stomach lining. The drug has been used for prevention of stress ulcers, the type seen in patients exposed to physical stress such as burns and surgery. It has no systemic effects. | No
7059 | NarrativeText | Sucralfate is well tolerated. It is poorly absorbed, and its most common side effect is constipation in 2% of patients. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort, indigestion, flatulence, dry mouth, rash, pruritus (itch- ing), back pain, headache, dizziness, sleepiness, and ver- tigo have been reported, as well as rare allergic respons- es. Because sucralfate releases small amounts of alu- minum into the system, it should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency.

7091 | NarrativeText | Antiviral drugs are medicines that cure or control virus infections. | No
7092 | Title | Purpose | No
7093 | NarrativeText | Antivirals are used to treat infections caused by viruses. Unlike antibacterial drugs, which may cover a wide range of pathogens, antiviral agents tend to be nar- row in spectrum, and have limited efficacy. | No
7094 | Title | Description | No
7095 | NarrativeText | Exclusive of the antiretroviral agents used in HIV (AIDS) therapy, there are currently only 11 antiviral drugs available, covering four types of virus. Acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Val- trex) are effective against herpesvirus, including herpes zoster and herpes genitalis. They may also be of value in either conditions caused by herpes, such as chickenpox and shingles. These drugs are not curative, but may reduce the pain of a herpes outbreak and shorten the period of viral shedding. | No
7096 | NarrativeText | Amantadine (Symmetrel), oseltamivir (Tamiflu), rimantidine (Flumadine), and zanamivir (Relenza) are useful in treatment of influenza virus. Amantadine, rimantadine, and oseltamivir may be administered throughout the flu season as preventatives for patients who cannot take influenza virus vaccine. | No
7097 | NarrativeText | Cidofovir (Vistide), foscarnet (Foscavir), and ganci- clovir (Cytovene) have been beneficial in treatment of cytomegalovirus in immunosupressed patients, primarily HIV-positive patients and transplant recipients. Ribavirin (Virazole) is used to treat respiratory syncytial virus. In combination with interferons, ribavirin has shown some efficacy against hepatitis C, and there have been anecdo- tal reports of utility against other types of viral infections. | No
7098 | NarrativeText | As aclass, the antivirals are not curative, and must be used either prophylactically or early in the development of an infection. Their mechanism of action is typically to inactivate the enzymes needed for viral replication. This will reduce the rate of viral growth, but will not inactive the virus already present. Antiviral therapy must normally be initiated within 48 hours of the onset of an infection to provide any benefit. Drugs used for influenza may be used throughout the influenza season in high risk patients, or within 48 hours of exposure to a known carrier. Anti- herpetic agents should be used at the first signs of an out- break. Anti-cytomegaloviral drugs must routinely be used as part of a program of secondary prophylaxis (mainte- nance therapy following an initial response) in order to prevent reinfection in immunocompromised patients. | No

7102 | NarrativeText | Ganciclovir is available in intravenous injection, oral capsules, and intraoccular inserts. The capsules should be reserved for prophylactic use in organ transplant patients, or for HIV infected patients who cannot be treated with the intravenous drug. The toxicity profile of this drug when administered systemically includes granulocytope- nia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The drug is in preg- nancy category C, but has caused significant fetal abnor- malities in animal studies including cleft palate and organ defects. Breast feeding is not recommended. | No
7103 | NarrativeText | Cidofovir causes renal toxicity in 53% of patients. Patients should be well hydrated, and renal function should be checked regularly. Other common adverse effects are nausea and vomiting in 65% or patients, asthenia in 46% and headache and diarrhea, both reported in 27% of cases. The drug is category C in preg- nancy, due to fetal abnormalities in animal studies. Breast feeding is not recommended. | No
7104 | NarrativeText | Foscarnet is used in treatment of immunocompro- mised patients with cytomegalovirus infections and in acyclovir-resistant herpes simples virus. The primary hazard is renal toxicity. Alterations in electrolyte levels may cause seizures. Foscarnet is category C during preg- nancy. The drug has caused skeletal abnormailities in developing fetuses. It is not known whether foscarnet is excreted in breast milk, however the drug does appear in breast milk in animal studies. | No
7105 | NarrativeText | Valaciclovir is metabolized to acyclovir, so that the hazards of the two drugs are very similar. They are gener- ally well tolerated, but nausea and headache are common adverse effects. They are both pregnancy category B. Although there have been no reports of fetal abnormali- ties attributable to either drug, the small number of report- ed cases makes it impossible to draw conclusions regard- ing safety in pregnancy. Acyclovir is found in breast milk, but no adverse effects have been reported in the newborn. Famciclovir is similar in actions and adverse effects. | No
7106 | NarrativeText | Ribavirin is used by aerosol for treatment of hospital- ized infants and young children with severe lower respira- tory tract infections due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

7130 | NarrativeText | Anxiety is a multisystem response to a perceived threat or danger. It reflects a combination of biochemical changes in the body, the patient’s personal history and memory, and the social situation. As far as we know, anxi- ety is a uniquely human experience. Other animals clearly know fear, but human anxiety involves an ability, to use memory and imagination to move backward and forward in time, that animals do not appear to have. The anxiety that occurs in post-traumatic syndromes indicates that human memory is a much more complicated mental func- tion than animal memory. Moreover, a large portion of human anxiety is produced by anticipation of future events. Without a sense of personal continuity over time, people would not have the “raw materials” of anxiety. | No
7131 | NarrativeText | It is important to distinguish between anxiety as a feeling or experience, and an anxiety disorder as a psy- chiatric diagnosis. A person may feel anxious without having an anxiety disorder. Also a person facing a clear and present danger or a realistic fear is not usually con- sidered to be in a state of anxiety. In addition, anxiety frequently occurs as a symptom in other categories of psychiatric disturbance. | No
7132 | Title | Description | No
7133 | NarrativeText | Although anxiety is a commonplace experience that everyone has from time to time, it is difficult to describe concretely because it has so many different potential caus- es and degrees of intensity. Doctors sometimes categorize anxiety as an emotion or an affect depending on whether it is being described by the person having it (emotion) or by an outside observer (affect). The word emotion is general- ly used for the biochemical changes and feeling state that underlie a person’s internal sense of anxiety. Affect is used to describe the person’s emotional state from an observer’s perspective. If a doctor says that a patient has an anxious affect, he or she means that the patient appears nervous or anxious, or responds to others in an anxious way (for example, the individual is shaky, tremulous, etc.). | No
7134 | NarrativeText | Although anxiety is related to fear, it is not the same thing. Fear is a direct, focused response to a specific event or object, and the person is consciously aware of it. Most people will feel fear if someone points a loaded gun at them or if they see a tornado forming on the horizon. They also will recognize that they are afraid. Anxiety, on the other hand, is often unfocused, vague, and hard to pin down to a specific cause. In this form it is called free-float- ing anxiety. Sometimes anxiety being experienced in the present may stem from an event or person that produced pain and fear in the past, but the anxious individual is not consciously aware of the original source of the feeling. It is anxiety’s aspect of remoteness that makes it hard for people to compare their experiences of it. Whereas most people will be fearful in physically dangerous situations, and can agree that fear is an appropriate response in the presence of danger, anxiety is often triggered by objects or events that are unique and specific to an individual. An individual might be anxious because of a unique meaning or memory being stimulated by present circumstances, not because of some immediate danger. Another individual looking at the anxious person from the outside may be truly puzzled as to the reason for the person’s anxiety. | No
7135 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7136 | NarrativeText | Anxiety can have a number of different causes. It is a multidimensional response to stimuli in the person’s environment, or a response to an internal stimulus (for example, a hypochondriac’s reaction to a stomach rum- bling) resulting from a combination of general biological and individual psychological processes. | No
7137 | Title | Physical | No
7138 | NarrativeText | In some cases, anxiety is produced by physical respons- es to stress, or by certain disease processes or medications. | No
7139 | NarrativeText | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS). The ner- vous system of human beings is “hard-wired” to respond to dangers or threats. These responses are not subject to conscious control, and are the same in humans as in lower animals. They represent an evolutionary adaptation to the animal predators and other dangers with which all animals, including primitive humans, had to cope. The most familiar reaction of this type is the so-called “fight- or-flight” reaction. This response is the human organ- ism’s automatic “red alert” in a life-threatening situation. It is a state of physiological and emotional hyperarousal marked by high muscle tension and strong feelings of fear or anger. When a person has a fight-or-flight reac- tion, the level of stress hormones in their blood rises. They become more alert and attentive, their eyes dilate, their heartbeat increases, their breathing rate increases, and their digestion slows down, allowing more energy to be available to the muscles. | No
7140 | NarrativeText | This emergency reaction is regulated by a part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, or ANS. The ANS is controlled by the hypothalamus, a spe- cialized part of the brainstem that is among a group of structures called the limbic system. The limbic system controls human emotions through its connections to glands and muscles; it also connects to the ANS and “higher” brain centers, such as parts of the cerebral cor- tex. One problem with this arrangement is that the limbic system cannot tell the difference between a realistic physical threat and an anxiety-producing thought or idea. The hypothalamus may trigger the release of stress hor- mones by the pituitary gland, even when there is no external and objective danger. A second problem is caused by the biochemical side effects of too many “false alarms” in the ANS. When a person responds to a real danger, his or her body gets rid of the stress hormones by running away or by fighting. In modern life, however, people often have fight-or-flight reactions in situations in which they can neither run away nor lash out physically. As aresult, their bodies have to absorb all the biochemi- cal changes of hyperarousal, rather than release them. These biochemical changes can produce anxious feel- ings, as well as muscle tension and other physical symp- toms associated with anxiety. They may even produce permanent changes in the brain, if the process occurs repeatedly. Moreover, chronic physical disorders, such as coronary artery disease, may be worsened by anxiety, as chronic hyperarousal puts undue stress on the heart, | No
7141 | NarrativeText | DISEASES AND DISORDERS. Anxiety can be a symp- tom of certain medical conditions. Some of these dis- eases are disorders of the endocrine system, such as Cushing’s syndrome (overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal cortex), and include over- or underactivity of the | No

7144 | NarrativeText | MEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE. Numerous medications may cause anxiety-like symptoms as a side effect. They include birth control pills; some thyroid or asthma drugs; some psychotropic agents; occasionally, local anesthetics; corticosteroids; antihypertensive drugs; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like flurbiprofen and ibuprofen). | No
7145 | NarrativeText | Although people do not usually think of caffeine as a drug, it can cause anxiety-like symptoms when con- sumed in sufficient quantity. Patients who consume caf- feine rich foods and beverages, such as chocolate, cocoa, coffee, tea, or carbonated soft drinks (especially cola beverages), can sometimes lower their anxiety symptoms simply by reducing their intake of these substances. | No
7146 | NarrativeText | Withdrawal from certain prescription drugs, primari- ly beta blockers and corticosteroids, can cause anxiety. Withdrawal from drugs of abuse, including LSD, cocaine, alcohol, and opiates, can also cause anxiety. | No
7147 | Title | Learned associations | No
7148 | NarrativeText | Some aspects of anxiety appear to be unavoidable byproducts of the human developmental process. Humans are unique among animals in that they spend an unusually long period of early life in a relatively helpless condition, and a sense of helplessness can lead to anxi- ety. The extended period of human dependency on adults means that people may remember, and learn to antici- pate, frightening or upsetting experiences long before they are capable enough to feel a sense of mastery over their environment. In addition, the fact that anxiety dis- orders often run in families indicates that children can learn unhealthy attitudes and behaviors from parents, as well as healthy ones. Also, recurrent disorders in families may indicate that there is a genetic or inherited compo- nent in some anxiety disorders. For example, there has been found to be a higher rate of anxiety disorders (panic) in identical twins than in fraternal twins. | No
7149 | NarrativeText | CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND ANXIETY. Re- searchers in early childhood development regard anxiety in adult life as a residue of childhood memories of dependency. Humans learn during the first year of life that they are not self-sufficient and that their basic sur- vival depends on the care of others. It is thought that this early experience of helplessness underlies the most com- mon anxieties of adult life, including fear of powerless- ness and fear of being unloved. Thus, adults can be made anxious by symbolic threats to their sense of competence and/or significant relationships, even though they are no longer helpless children. | No
7150 | NarrativeText | SYMBOLIZATION. The psychoanalytic model gives considerable weight to the symbolic aspect of human anxiety; examples include phobic disorders, obsessions, compulsions, and other forms of anxiety that are highly individualized. The length of the human maturation process allows many opportunities for children and ado- lescents to connect their experiences with certain objects or events that can bring back feelings in later life. For example, a person who was frightened as a child by a tall man wearing glasses may feel panicky years later by something that reminds him of that person or experience without consciously knowing why. | No
7151 | NarrativeText | Freud thought that anxiety results from a person’s internal conflicts. According to his theory, people feel anxious when they feel torn between desires or urges toward certain actions, on the one hand, and moral restrictions, on the other. In some cases, the person’s anxiety may attach itself to an object that represents the inner conflict. For example, someone who feels anxious around money may be pulled between a desire to steal and the belief that stealing is wrong. Money becomes a symbol for the inner conflict between doing what is con- sidered right and doing what one wants. | No
7152 | NarrativeText | PHOBIAS. Phobias are a special type of anxiety reaction in which the person’s anxiety is concentrated on a specific object or situation that the person then tries to avoid. In most cases, the person’s fear is out of all pro- portion to its “cause.” Prior to the Diagnostic and Statis- tical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), these specific phobias were called simple phobias. It is estimated that 10-11% of the population will develop a phobia in the course of their lives. Some phobias, such as agoraphobia (fear of open spaces), claustrophobia (fear of small or confined spaces), and social phobia, are shared by large numbers of people. Others are less com- mon or unique to the patient. | No
7153 | Title | Social and environmental stressors | No
7154 | NarrativeText | Anxiety often has a social dimension because humans are social creatures. People frequently report feelings of high anxiety when they anticipate and, there- fore, fear the loss of social approval or love. Social phobia is a specific anxiety disorder that is marked by high levels of anxiety or fear of embarrassment in social situations. | No
7155 | NarrativeText | Another social stressor is prejudice. People who belong to groups that are targets of bias are at higher risk for developing anxiety disorders. Some experts think, for example, that the higher rates of phobias and panic dis- order among women reflects their greater social and economic vulnerability. | No
7156 | NarrativeText | Some controversial studies indicate that the increase in violent or upsetting pictures and stories in news reports and entertainment may raise the anxiety level of many people. Stress and anxiety management programs often suggest that patients cut down their exposure to upsetting stimuli. | No
7157 | NarrativeText | Anxiety may also be caused by environmental or occupational factors. People who must live or work around sudden or loud noises, bright or flashing lights, chemical vapors, or similar nuisances, which they cannot avoid or control, may develop heightened anxiety levels. | No
7158 | Title | Existential anxiety | No
7159 | NarrativeText | Another factor that shapes human experiences of anxiety is knowledge of personal mortality. Humans are the only animals that appear to be aware of their limited life span. Some researchers think that awareness of death influences experiences of anxiety from the time that a person is old enough to understand death. | No
7160 | Title | Symptoms of anxiety | No
7161 | NarrativeText | In order to understand the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of its symptoms. | No
7162 | NarrativeText | SOMATIC. The somatic or physical symptoms of anxiety include headaches, dizziness or lightheadedness, nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, tingling, pale com- plexion, sweating, numbness, difficulty in breathing, and sensations of tightness in the chest, neck, shoulders, or hands. These symptoms are produced by the hormonal, muscular, and cardiovascular reactions involved in the fight-or-flight reaction. | No
7163 | NarrativeText | BEHAVIORAL. Behavioral symptoms of anxiety include pacing, trembling, general restlessness, hyper- ventilation, pressured speech, hand wringing, or finger tapping. | No
7164 | NarrativeText | COGNITIVE. Cognitive symptoms of anxiety include recurrent or obsessive thoughts, feelings of doom, mor- bid or fear-inducing thoughts or ideas, and confusion, or inability to concentrate. | No
7165 | NarrativeText | EMOTIONAL. Feeling states associated with anxiety include tension or nervousness, feeling “hyper” or “keyed up,” and feelings of unreality, panic, or terror. | No
7166 | NarrativeText | DEFENSE MECHANISMS. In psychoanalytic theory, the symptoms of anxiety in humans may arise from or activate a number of unconscious defense mechanisms. Because of these defenses, it is possible for a person to be anxious without being consciously aware of it or appearing anxious to others. These psychological defens- es include: ¢ Repression. The person pushes anxious thoughts or ideas out of conscious awareness. | No
7167 | ListItem | ¢ Displacement. Anxiety from one source is attached to a different object or event. Phobias are an example of the mechanism of displacement in psychoanalytic theory. | No
7168 | ListItem | ¢ Rationalization. The person justifies the anxious feel- ings by saying that any normal person would feel anx- ious in their situation. | No
7169 | ListItem | ¢ Somatization. The anxiety emerges in the form of phys- ical complaints and illnesses, such as recurrent headaches, stomach upsets, or muscle and joint pain. | No
7170 | ListItem | ¢ Delusion formation. The person converts anxious feel- ings into conspiracy theories or similar ideas without reality testing. Delusion formation can involve groups as well as individuals. | No
7171 | NarrativeText | Other theorists attribute some drug addiction to the desire to relieve symptoms of anxiety. Most addictions, they argue, originate in the use of mood-altering sub- stances or behaviors to “medicate” anxious feelings. | No
7172 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7173 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of anxiety is difficult and complex because of the variety of its causes and the highly personal- ized and individualized nature of its symptom formation. There are no medical tests that can be used to diagnose anxiety by itself. When a doctor examines an anxious patient, he or she will first rule out physical conditions and diseases that have anxiety as a symptom. Apart from these exclusions, the physical examination is usually inconclu- sive. Some anxious patients may have their blood pressure or pulse rate affected by anxiety, or may look pale or per- spire heavily, but others may appear physically completely normal. The doctor will then take the patient’s medication, dietary, and occupational history to see if they are taking prescription drugs that might cause anxiety, if they are abusing alcohol or mood-altering drugs, if they are con- suming large amounts of caffeine, or if their workplace is noisy or dangerous. In most cases, the most important source of diagnostic information is the patient’s psycholog- ical and social history. The doctor may administer a brief psychological test to help evaluate the intensity of the patient’s anxiety and some of its features. Some tests that are often given include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). Many doc- tors will check a number of chemical factors in the blood, such as the level of thyroid hormone and blood sugar. | No
7174 | Title | Treatment | No
7175 | NarrativeText | Not all patients with anxiety require treatment, but for more severe cases, treatment is recommended. | No
7176 | Title | 320 | No
7177 | NarrativeText | Because anxiety often has more than one cause and is experienced in highly individual ways, its treatment usu- ally requires more than one type of therapy. In addition, there is no way to tell in advance how patients will respond to a specific drug or therapy. Sometimes the doc- tor will need to try different medications or methods of treatment before finding the best combination for the particular patient. It usually takes about six to eight weeks for the doctor to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment regimen. | No
7178 | Title | Medications | No
7179 | NarrativeText | Medications are often prescribed to relieve the phys- ical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Most agents work by counteracting the biochemical and muscular changes involved in the fight-or-flight reaction. Some work directly on the chemicals in the brain that are thought to underlie the anxiety. | No
7180 | NarrativeText | ANXIOLYTICS. Anxiolytics are sometimes called tranquilizers. Most anxiolytic drugs are either benzodi- azepines or barbiturates. Barbiturates, once commonly used, are now rarely used in clinical practice. Barbitu- rates work by slowing down the transmission of nerve impulses from the brain to other parts of the body. They include such drugs as phenobarbital (Luminal) and pen- tobarbital (Nembutal). Benzodiazepines work by relax- ing the skeletal muscles and calming the limbic system. They include such drugs as chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium). Both barbiturates and benzodi- azepines are potentially habit-forming and may cause withdrawal symptoms, but benzodiazepines are far less likely than barbiturates to cause physical dependency. Both drugs also increase the effects of alcohol and should never be taken in combination with it. | No
7181 | NarrativeText | Two other types of anxiolytic medications include meprobamate (Equanil), which is now rarely used, and buspirone (BuSpar), a new type of anxiolytic that appears to work by increasing the efficiency of the body’s own emotion-regulating brain chemicals. Buspirone has sever- al advantages over other anxiolytics. It does not cause dependence problems, does not interact with alcohol, and does not affect the patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery. However, buspirone is not effective against certain types of anxiety, such as panic disorder. | No
7182 | NarrativeText | ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. For some anxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disor- der and panic type anxiety, a type of drugs used to treat depression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; such as Prozac and Paxil), are the treatment of choice. Because anxiety often coexists with symptoms of depression, many doctors prescribe antidepressant med- ications for anxious/depressed patients. While SSRIs are more common, antidepressants are sometimes pre- scribed, including tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) such as phenelzine (Nardil). | No
7183 | NarrativeText | Beta-blockers are medications that work by blocking the body’s reaction to the stress hormones that are released during the fight-or-flight reaction. They include drugs like propranolol (Inderal) or atenolol (Tenormin). Beta-blockers are sometimes given to patients with post- traumatic anxiety symptoms. More commonly, the beta- blockers are given to patients with a mild form of social phobic anxiety, such as fear of public speaking. | No
7184 | Title | Psychotherapy | No
7185 | NarrativeText | Most patients with anxiety will be given some form of psychotherapy along with medications. Many patients benefit from insight-oriented therapies, which are designed to help them uncover unconscious conflicts and defense mechanisms in order to understand how their symptoms developed. Patients who are extremely anxious may benefit from supportive psychotherapy, which aims at symptom reduction rather than personality restructuring. | No
7186 | NarrativeText | Two newer approaches that work well with anxious patients are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and relaxation training. In CBT, the patient is taught to identify the thoughts and situations that stimulate his or her anxi- ety, and to view them more realistically. In the behavioral part of the program, the patient is exposed to the anxiety- provoking object, situation, or internal stimulus (like a rapid heart beat) in gradual stages until he or she is desen- sitized to it. Relaxation training, which is sometimes called anxiety management training, includes breathing exercises and similar techniques intended to help the patient prevent hyperventilation and relieve the muscle tension associated with the fight-or-flight reaction. Both CBT and relaxation training can be used in group therapy as well as individual treatment. In addition to CBT, sup- port groups are often helpful to anxious patients, because they provide a social network and lessen the embarrass- ment that often accompanies anxiety symptoms. | No
7187 | Title | Psychosurgery | No
7188 | NarrativeText | Surgery on the brain is very rarely recommended for patients with anxiety; however, some patients with severe cases of obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) have been helped by an operation on a part of the brain that is involved in OCD. Normally, this operation is attempted after all other treatments have failed. | No
7189 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
7190 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of approaches. Meditation and mindfulness training are thought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor- der. Hydrotherapy is useful to some anxious patients because it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys- tem. Yoga, aikido, t’ai chi, and dance therapy help patients work with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensions that either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety. | No
7191 | NarrativeText | Homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine approach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder. Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on other associated symptoms and the patient’s general con- stitution. Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockage of qi, or vital force, inside the patient’s body that is most likely to affect the lung and large intestine meridian flow. The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupunc- ture point locations and/or herbal therapy to move the qi and rebalance the entire system in relation to the lung and large intestine. | No

7194 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for resolution of anxiety depends on the specific disorder and a wide variety of factors, including the patient’s age, sex, general health, living sit- uation, belief system, social support network, and responses to different anxiolytic medications and forms of therapy. | No
7195 | Title | Prevention | No
7196 | NarrativeText | Humans have significant control over thoughts, and, therefore, may learn ways of preventing anxiety by changing irrational ideas and beliefs. Humans also have some power over anxiety arising from social and envi- ronmental conditions. Other forms of anxiety, however, are built into the human organism and its life cycle, and cannot be prevented or eliminated. | No

7219 | NarrativeText | The anxiety disorders are a group of mental distur- bances characterized by anxiety as a central or core symp- tom. Although anxiety is a commonplace experience, not everyone who experiences it has an anxiety disorder. Anx- iety is associated with a wide range of physical illnesses, medication side effects, and other psychiatric disorders. | No
7220 | NarrativeText | The revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Man- ual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that took place after 1980 brought major changes in the classification of the anxiety disorders. Prior to 1980, psychiatrists classified patients on the basis of a theory of causality that defined anxiety as the outcome of unconscious conflicts in the patient’s mind. DSM-III (1980), DSM-III-R (1987), and DSM-IV (1994) introduced and refined a new classifica- tion that took into consideration recent discoveries about the biochemical and post-traumatic origins of some types of anxiety. The present definitions are based on the exter- nal and reported symptom patterns of the disorders rather than on theories about their origins. | No
7221 | Title | Description | No
7222 | NarrativeText | Anxiety disorders are the most common form of mental disturbance in the United States population. It is estimated that 28 million persons suffer from an anxiety disorder every year. These disorders are a serious prob- lem for the entire society because of their interference with patients’ work, schooling, and family life. They also contribute to the high rates of alcohol and substance abuse in the United States. Anxiety disorders are an addi- tional problem for health professionals because the phys- ical symptoms of anxiety frequently bring people to pri- mary care doctors or emergency rooms. | No
7223 | NarrativeText | DSM-IV defines twelve types of anxiety disorders in the adult population. They can be grouped under seven headings: * Panic disorders with or without agoraphobia. The chief characteristic of panic disorder is the occurrence of panic attacks coupled with fear of their recurrence. In clinical settings, agoraphobia is usually not a disor- der by itself, but is typically associated with some form of panic disorder. Patients with agoraphobia are afraid of places or situations in which they might have a panic attack and be unable to leave or to find help. About 25% of patients with panic disorder develop obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD). | No
7224 | ListItem | ¢ Phobias. These include specific phobias and social phobia. A phobia is an intense irrational fear of a spe- | No
7225 | NarrativeText | cific object or situation that compels the patient to avoid it. Some phobias concern activities or objects that involve some risk (for example, flying or driving) but many are focused on harmless animals or other objects. Social phobia involves a fear of being humiliated, judged, or scrutinized. It manifests itself as a fear of performing certain functions in the presence of others, such as public speaking or using public lavatories. | No
7226 | ListItem | * Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This disorder is marked by unwanted, intrusive, persistent thoughts or repetitive behaviors that reflect the patient’s anxiety or attempts to control it. It affects between 2-3% of the population and is much more common than was previ- ously thought. | No
7227 | ListItem | « Stress disorders. These include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder. Stress dis- orders are symptomatic reactions to traumatic events in the patient’s life. | No
7228 | ListItem | ¢ Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is the most commonly diagnosed anxiety disorder and occurs most frequently in young adults. | No
7229 | ListItem | « Anxiety disorders due to known physical causes. These include general medical conditions or substance abuse. | No
7230 | ListItem | ¢ Anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. This last cate- gory is not a separate type of disorder, but is included to cover symptoms that do not meet the specific DSM-IV criteria for other anxiety disorders. | No
7231 | NarrativeText | All DSM-IV anxiety disorder diagnoses include a criterion of severity. The anxiety must be severe enough to interfere significantly with the patient’s occupational or educational functioning, social activities or close rela- tionships, and other customary activities. | No
7232 | NarrativeText | The anxiety disorders vary widely in their frequency of occurrence in the general population, age of onset, family patterns, and gender distribution. The stress disor- ders and anxiety disorders caused by medical conditions or substance abuse are less age- and gender-specific. Whereas OCD affects males and females equally, GAD, panic disorder, and specific phobias all affect women more frequently than men. GAD and panic disorders are more likely to develop in young adults, while phobias and OCD can begin in childhood. | No
7233 | Title | Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents | No
7234 | NarrativeText | DSM-IV defines one anxiety disorder as specific to children, namely, separation anxiety disorder. This disor- der is defined as anxiety regarding separation from home or family that is excessive or inappropriate for the child’s age. In some children, separation anxiety takes the form of school avoidance. | No
7235 | NarrativeText | Children and adolescents can also be diagnosed with panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, and the post- traumatic stress syndromes. | No
7236 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7237 | NarrativeText | The causes of anxiety include a variety of individual and general social factors, and may produce physical, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral symptoms. The patient’s ethnic or cultural background may also influ- ence his or her vulnerability to certain forms of anxiety. Genetic factors that lead to biochemical abnormalities may also play a role. | No
7238 | NarrativeText | Anxiety in children may be caused by suffering from abuse, as well as by the factors that cause anxiety in adults. | No
7239 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7240 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of anxiety disorders is complicated by the variety of causes of anxiety and the range of disor- ders that may include anxiety as a symptom. Many patients who suffer from anxiety disorders have features or symptoms of more than one disorder. Patients whose anxiety is accounted for by another psychic disorder, such as schizophrenia or major depression, are not diag- nosed with an anxiety disorder. A doctor examining an anxious patient will usually begin by ruling out diseases that are known to cause anxiety and then proceed to take the patient’s medication history, in order to exclude side effects of prescription drugs. Most doctors will ask about caffeine consumption to see if the patient’s dietary habits are a factor. The patient’s work and family situation will also be discussed. Laboratory tests for blood sugar and thyroid function are also common | No
7241 | Title | Diagnostic testing for anxiety | No
7242 | NarrativeText | There are no laboratory tests that can diagnose anxi- ety, although the doctor may order some specific tests to tule out disease conditions. Although there is no psychi- atric test that can provide definite diagnoses of anxiety dis- orders, there are several short-answer interviews or symp- tom inventories that doctors can use to evaluate the inten- sity of a patient’s anxiety and some of its associated fea- tures. These measures include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). | No
7243 | Title | Treatment | No
7244 | NarrativeText | For relatively mild anxiety disorders, psychotherapy alone may suffice. In general, doctors prefer to use a com- bination of medications and psychotherapy with more severely anxious patients. Most patients respond better to a combination of treatment methods than to either med- ications or psychotherapy in isolation. Because of the variety of medications and treatment approaches that are used to treat anxiety disorders, the doctor cannot predict in advance which combination will be most helpful to a specific patient. In many cases the doctor will need to try anew medication or treatment over a six- to eight-week period in order to assess its effectiveness. Treatment trials do not necessarily mean that the patient cannot be helped or that the doctor is incompetent. | No
7245 | NarrativeText | Although anxiety disorders are not always easy to diagnose, there are several reasons why it is important for patients with severe anxiety symptoms to get help. Anxi- ety doesn’t always go away by itself; it often progresses to panic attacks, phobias, and episodes of depression. Untreated anxiety disorders may eventually lead to a diag- nosis of major depression, or interfere with the patient’s education or ability to keep a job. In addition, many anx- ious patients develop addictions to drugs or alcohol when they try to “medicate” their symptoms. Moreover, since children learn ways of coping with anxiety from their par- ents, adults who get help for anxiety disorders are in a bet- ter position to help their families cope with factors that lead to anxiety than those who remain untreated. | No
7246 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
7247 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of approaches. Meditation and mindfulness training are thought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor- der. Hydrotherapy is useful to some anxious patients because it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys- tem. Yoga, aikido, t’ai chi, and dance therapy help patients work with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensions that either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety. | No
7248 | NarrativeText | Homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine approach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder. Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on other associated symptoms and the patient’s general constitution. Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockage of qi, or vital force, inside the patient’s body that is most likely to affect the lung and large intestine meridian flow.

7270 | NarrativeText | An aneurysm is an abnormal bulging or swelling of a portion of a blood vessel. The aorta, which can develop these abnormal bulges, is the large blood vessel that car- ries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. | No
7271 | Title | Description | No
7272 | NarrativeText | The aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, and is therefore called an artery. Because the aorta is an artery, its walls are made of up three layers; a thin inner layer, a muscular middle layer (that gives the vessel its flexibility under pressure from the filling blood), and a fiber-like outer layer that gives the vessel strength to not burst when the heart pumps blood to the body. | No
7273 | NarrativeText | Aortic aneurysms occur when a weakness develops in part of the wall of the aorta; three basic types are usual- ly found. If all three layers of the vessel are affected and weakness develops along an extended area of the vessel, the weakened area will appear as a large, bulging region of blood vessel; this is called a fusiform aneurysm.

This is called a dissecting aneurysm because one layer is “dissected” or separated from another. If damage occurs to only the mid- dle (muscular) layer of the vessel, a sack-like bulge can form; therefore, this is a saccular aneurysm. | No
7276 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7277 | NarrativeText | Aortic aneurysms occur in different portions of the aorta, which begins in the chest (at the heart) and travels downward through the abdomen. Aneurysms found in the region of the aorta within the chest are called thoracic aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms that occur in the part of the aorta within the abdomen are called abdominal aortic aneurysms. | No
7278 | NarrativeText | Thoracic aortic aneurysms do not usually produce any noticeable symptoms. However, as the aneurysm becomes larger, chest, shoulder, neck, lower back, or abdominal pain can result. Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur more often in men, and these aneurysms can cause pain in the lower back, hips, and abdomen. A painful abdominal aortic aneurysm usually means that the aneurysm could burst very soon. | No
7279 | NarrativeText | Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused by atherosclerosis, a condition caused when fat (mostly cholesterol) carried in the blood builds up in the inner wall of the aorta. As more and more fat attaches to the aortic wall, the wall itself becomes abnormally weak and often results in an aneurysm or bulge. | No
7280 | NarrativeText | Aortic aneurysms are also caused by a breakdown of the muscular middle layer of the artery wall, by high blood pressure, by direct injury to the chest, and although rare, by bacteria that can infect the aorta. | No

7287 | NarrativeText | Aortic aneurysms are potentially life-threatening con- ditions.

7305 | NarrativeText | Aortic dissection is a rare, but potentially fatal, con- dition in which blood passes through the inner lining and between the layers of the aorta. The dissecting aorta usu- ally does not burst, but has an abnormal second channel within it. | No
7306 | Title | Description | No
7307 | NarrativeText | A defect in the inner lining of the aorta allows an opening or tear to develop. The aorta is the main artery of the body and is an area of high blood pressure. When a defect develops, blood pressure can force the tear to open and allow blood to pass through. Since the blood is under pressure, it eventually splits (dissecting) the middle layer of the blood vessel, creating a new channel for blood. The length of the channel grows over time and can result in the closing off of connection points to other arteries. This can lead to heart attack, strokes, abdominal pain, and nerve damage. Blood may leak from the dissection and collect in the chest an around the heart. | No
7308 | NarrativeText | A second mechanism leading to aortic dissection is medial hemorrhage. A medial hemorrhage occurs in the middle layer of the blood vessel and spills through the inner lining of the aorta wall. This opening then allows blood from the aorta to enter the vessel wall and begin a dissection. Approximately 2,000 cases of aortic dissec- tion occur yearly in the United States. | No
7309 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7310 | NarrativeText | Aortic dissection is caused by a deterioration of the inner lining of the aorta. There are a number of condi- tions that predispose a person to develop defects of the inner lining, including high blood pressure, Marfan’s dis- ease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, connective tissue dis- eases, and defects of heart development which begin dur- ing fetal development. A dissection can also occur acci- dentally following insertion of a catheter, trauma, or surgery. The main symptom is sudden, intense pain. The pain can be so intense as to immobilize the patient and cause him to fall to the ground. The pain is frequently felt in both the chest and in the back, between the shoul- der blades. The extent of the pain is proportional to the length of the dissection. | No
7311 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7312 | NarrativeText | The pain experienced by the patient is the first symp- tom of aortic dissection and is unique. The pain is usually described by the patient as “tearing, ripping, or stabbing.” This is in contrast to the pain associated with heart attacks. The patient frequently has a reduced or absent pulse in the extremities. A murmur may be heard if the dissection is close to the heart. An enlarged aorta will usu- ally appear in the chest x rays and ultrasound exams of most patients. The use of a blood dye in angiograms and/or CT scans (computed tomography scans) will aid in diagnosing and visualizing the dissection. | No
7313 | Title | Treatment | No
7314 | NarrativeText | Because of the potentially fatal nature of aortic dis- section, patients are treated immediately. Drugs are administered to reduce the blood pressure and heart rate. If the dissection is small, drug therapy alone may be used. In other cases, surgery is performed. In surgery, damaged sections of the aorta are removed and a synthet- ic graft is often used to reconstruct the damaged vessel. | No
7315 | Title | Prognosis | No

7364 | NarrativeText | When aortic valve stenosis occurs, the aortic valve, located between the aorta and left ventricle of the heart, is narrower than normal size. | No
7365 | Title | Description | No
7366 | NarrativeText | A normal aortic valve, when open, allows the free flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta. When the valve narrows, as it does with stenosis, blood flow is impeded. Because it is more difficult for blood to flow through the valve, there is increased strain on the heart. This can cause the left ventricle to enlarge and malfunction, resulting in reduced blood supply to the heart muscle and body, as well as fluid build up in the lungs. | No
7367 | Title | Cause and symptoms | No
7368 | NarrativeText | Aortic valve stenosis can occur because of a birth defect in the formation of the valve. Calcium deposits may form on the valve with aging, causing the valve to become stiff and narrow. Stenosis can also occur as a result of rheumatic fever. Mild aortic stenosis may pro- duce no symptoms at all. The most common symptoms, depending on the severity of the disease, are chest pain, blackouts, and difficulty breathing. | No

7371 | NarrativeText | Using a stethoscope, a physician may hear a murmur and other abnormal heart sounds. An ECG, also called an electrocardiogram, records the electrical activity of the heart. This technique and chest x ray can show evidence that the left ventricle is enlarged. An x ray can also reveal calcium deposits on the valve, as well as congestion in the lungs. Echocardiography can pick up thickening of the valve, heart size, and whether or not the valve is working properly. This is a procedure in which high fre- quency sound waves harmlessly bounce off organs in the body. Cardiac catheterization, in which a contrast dye is injected in an artery using a catheter, is the key tool to confirm stenosis and gauge its severity. | No
7372 | Title | Treatment | No
7373 | NarrativeText | Treatment depends on the symptoms and how the heart’s function is affected. The valve can be opened with- out surgery by using a balloon catheter, but this is often a temporary solution. The procedure involves inserting a deflated balloon at the end of a catheter through the arteries to the valve. Inflating the balloon should widen the valve. In severe stenosis, heart valve replacement is recommended, most often involving open-heart surgery. The valve can be replaced with a mechanical valve, a valve from a pig, or by moving the patient’s other heart valve (pulmonary) into the position of the aortic valve and then replacing the pul- monary valve with an mechanical one. Anyone with aortic stenosis needs to take antibiotics (amoxicillin, ery- thromycin, or clindamycin) before dental and some other surgical procedures, to prevent a heart valve infection. | No

7398 | Title | Purpose | No
7399 | NarrativeText | Apgar scoring was originally developed in the 1950s by the anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar to assist practi- tioners attending a birth in deciding whether or not a newborn was in need of resuscitation. Using a scoring method fosters consistency and standardization among different practitioners. A February 2001 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine investigated whether Apgar scoring continues to be relevant. Researchers concluded that “The Apgar scoring system remains as relevant for the prediction of neonatal sur- vival today as it was almost 50 years ago”. | No

7401 | NarrativeText | The five areas are scored as follows: ¢ Appearance, or color: 2 if the skin is pink all over; 1 for acrocyanosis, where the trunk and head are pink, but the arms and legs are blue; and 0 if the whole body is blue. Newborns with naturally darker skin color will not be pink. However, pallor is still noticeable, espe- cially in the soles and palms. Color is related to the neonate’s ability to oxygenate its body and extremities, and is dependent on heart rate and respirations. A per- fectly healthy newborn will often receive a score of 9 because of some blueness in the hands and feet. | No

7421 | NarrativeText | As one of very few female medical students at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York during the early 1930s and one of the first women to graduate from its medical school, Apgar knew that her goal of becoming a surgeon would not be achieved easily in a male-dominated profession. Reluc- tantly, she switched her medical specialty to anesthesiol- ogy, she embraced her new field with typical intelligence and energy. At this time, anesthesiology was a relatively new field, having been left by the doctors mostly to the attention of nurses. Apgar realized immediately how much in need of scientifically trained personnel was this significant part of surgery, and she set out to make anes- thesiology a separate medical discipline. By 1937, she had become the fiftieth physician to be certified as an anesthesiologist in the United States. The following year she was appointed director of anesthesiology at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, becoming the first woman to head a department at that institution. | No

7423 | NarrativeText | As the attending anesthesiologist who assisted in the delivery of thousands of babies during these years, Apgar realized that infants had died from respiratory or circulato- ry complications that early treatment could have prevent- ed. Apgar decided to bring her considerable research skills to this childbirth dilemma, and her careful study resulted in her publication of the Apgar Score System in 1952. | No
7424 | NarrativeText | the newborn is considered normal, and therefore not a cause for concern. Most infants score between 7 and 10. These infants are expected to have an excellent outcome. A score of 4, 5, or 6 requires immediate intervention, usu- ally in the form of oxygen and respiratory assistance, or perhaps just suctioning if breathing has been obstructed by mucus. While suctioning is being done, a source of oxy- gen may be placed near, but not over the newborn’s nose and mouth. This form of oxygen is referred to as blow-by. A score in the 4-6 range indicates that the neonate is hav- ing some difficulty adapting to extrauterine life. This may be due to medications given to the mother during a diffi- cult labor, or at the very end of labor, when these medica- tions have an exaggerated effect on the neonate. | No

7442 | NarrativeText | Aphasia is condition characterized by either partial or total loss of the ability to communicate verbally or using written words. A person with aphasia may have difficulty speaking, reading, writing, recognizing the names of objects, or understanding what other people have said. Aphasia is caused by a brain injury, as may occur during a traumatic accident or when the brain is deprived of oxygen during a stroke. It may also be caused by a brain tumor, a disease such as Alzheimer’s, or an infection, like encephalitis. Aphasia may be tem- porary or permanent. Aphasia does not include speech impediments caused by loss of muscle control. | No
7443 | Title | Description | No
7444 | NarrativeText | To understand and use language effectively, an indi- vidual draws upon word memory—stored information on what certain words mean, how to put them together, and how and when to use them properly. For a majority of people, these and other language functions are located in the left side (hemisphere) of the brain. Damage to this side of the brain is most commonly linked to the devel- opment of aphasia. Interestingly, however, left-handed people appear to have language areas in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain and, as a result, may develop aphasia from damage to either side of the brain. | No
7445 | NarrativeText | Stroke is the most common cause of aphasia in the United States. Approximately 500,000 individuals suffer strokes each year, and 20% of these individuals develop some type of aphasia. Other causes of brain damage include head injuries, brain tumors, and infection. About half of the people who show signs of aphasia have what is called temporary or transient aphasia and recover com- pletely within a few days. An estimated one million Americans suffer from some form of permanent aphasia. As yet, no connection between aphasia and age, gender, or race has been found. | No
7446 | NarrativeText | Aphasia is sometimes confused with other conditions that affect speech, such as dysarthria and apraxia. These condition affect the muscles used in speaking rather than language function itself. Dysarthria is a speech distur- bance caused by lack of control over the muscles used in speaking, perhaps due to nerve damage. Speech apraxia is a speech disturbance in which language comprehension and muscle control are retained, but the memory of how to use the muscles to form words is not. | No
7447 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7448 | NarrativeText | Aphasia can develop after an individual sustains a brain injury from a stroke, head trauma, tumor, or infec- tion, such as herpes encephalitis. As a result of this injury, the pathways for language comprehension or production are disrupted or destroyed. For most people, this means damage to the left hemisphere of the brain. (In 95 to 99% of right-handed people, language centers are in the left hemisphere, and up to 70% of left-handed people also have left-hemisphere language dominance.) According to the traditional classification scheme, each form of aphasia is caused by damage to a different part of the left hemi- sphere of the brain. This damage affects one or more of the basic language functions: speech, naming (the ability to identify an object, color, or other item with an appropriate word or term), repetition (the ability to repeat words, phrases, and sentences), hearing comprehension (the abili- ty to understand spoken language), reading (the ability to understand written words and their meaning), and writing (the ability to communicate and record events with text). | No
7449 | NarrativeText | The traditional classification scheme includes eight types of aphasia: * Broca’s aphasia, also called motor aphasia, results from damage to the front portion or frontal lobe of the lan- guage-dominant area of the brain. Individuals with Broca’s aphasia may be completely unable to use speech (mutism) or may be able to use single-word statements or even full sentences, though these sentences may require a great deal of effort to construct. Small words, such as conjunctions (and, or, but) and articles (the, an, a), may be omitted, leading to a “telegraph” quality in their speech. Hearing comprehension is usually not affected, so they are able to understand other people’s speech and conversation and can follow commands. Often, they may experience weakness on the right side of their bodies, which can make it difficult to write. Read- ing ability is impaired, and they may have difficulty find- ing the right word when speaking. Individuals with Broca’s aphasia may become frustrated and depressed because they are aware of their language difficulties. | No
7450 | ListItem | * Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage to the side portion or temporal lobe of the language-dominant area Wernicke's area Broca's area | No
7451 | NarrativeText | Broca’s aphasia results from damage to the frontal lobe of the language-dominant area of the brain. Individuals with Broca’s aphasia may become mute or may be able to use single-word statements or full sentences, although it may require great effort. Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage to the temporal lobe of the language-dominant area of the brain. People with this condition speak in long, uninterrupt- ed sentences, but the words used are often unnecessary and unintelligible. (//lustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.) | No

They have a great deal of difficulty understanding other peo- ple’s speech, sometimes to the point of being unable to understand spoken language at all. Reading ability is diminished, and although writing ability is retained, what is written may be abnormal. No physical symp- toms, such as the right-sided weakness seen with Broca’s aphasia, are typically observed. Also, in con- trast to Broca’s aphasia, individuals with Wernicke’s aphasia are not aware of their language errors. | No
7453 | ListItem | Global aphasia is caused by widespread damage to the language areas of the left hemisphere. As a result, all basic language functions are affected, but some areas may be more affected than others. For example, an indi- vidual may have difficulty speaking but may be able to write well. The individual may experience weakness and loss of feeling on the right side of their body. | No
7454 | ListItem | Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia, is rather uncommon. Individuals with conduction aphasia are unable to repeat words, sentences, and phrases. | No
7455 | Title | 334 | No
7456 | NarrativeText | Speech is fairly unbroken, although individuals may frequently correct themselves and words may be skipped or repeated. Although able to understand spo- ken language, it may also be difficult for the individual with conduction aphasia to find the right word to describe a person or object. The impact of this condi- tion on reading and writing ability varies. As with other types of aphasia, right-sided weakness or sensory loss may be present. | No
7457 | ListItem | Anomic or nominal aphasia primarily influences an individual’s ability to find the right name for a person or object. As a result, an object may be described rather than named. Hearing comprehension, repetition, read- ing, and writing are not affected, other than by this inability to find the right name. Speech is fluent, except for pauses as the individual tries to recall the right name. Physical symptoms are variable, and some indi- viduals have no symptoms of one-sided weakness or sensory loss. | No
7458 | ListItem | Transcortical aphasia is caused by damage to the lan- guage areas of the left hemisphere outside the primary language areas. There are three types of aphasia: transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory apha- sia, and mixed transcortical aphasia. All of the transcor- tical aphasias are distinguished from other types by the individual’s ability to repeat words, phrases, or sen- tences. Other language functions may also be impaired to varying degrees, depending on the extent and partic- ular location of brain damage. | No
7459 | NarrativeText | As researchers continue to learn more about the brain’s structure and function, new types of aphasia are being recognized. One newly recognized type of aphasia, subcortical aphasia, mimics the symptoms of other tradi- tional types of aphasia but involves language disorders that are not typical. This type of aphasia is associated with injuries to areas of the brain typically not identified with language and language processing. | No
7460 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7461 | NarrativeText | Following brain injury, an initial bedside assessment is made to determine whether language function has been affected. If the individual experiences difficulty communi- cating, attempts are made to determine whether this diffi- culty arises from impaired language comprehension or an impaired ability to speak. A typical examination involves listening to spontaneous speech and evaluating the individ- ual’s ability to recognize and name objects, comprehend what is heard, and repeat sample words and phrases. The individual may also be asked to read text aloud and explain what the passage means. In addition, writing ability is eval- uated by having the individual copy text, transcribe dictated text, and write something without prompting. | No

7484 | NarrativeText | The degree to which an individual can recover lan- guage abilities is highly dependent on how much brain damage occurred and the location and cause of the origi- nal brain injury. Other factors include the individual’s age, general health, motivation and willingness to partici- pate in speech therapy, and whether the individual is left or right handed. Language areas may be located in both the left and right hemispheres in left-handed individuals. Left-handed individuals are, therefore, more likely to develop aphasia following brain injury, but because they have two language centers, may recover more fully because language abilities can be recovered from either side of the brain. The intensity of therapy and the time between diagnosis and the start of therapy may also affect the eventual outcome. | No
7485 | Title | Prevention | No
7486 | NarrativeText | Because there is no way of knowing when a stroke, traumatic head injury, or disease will occur, very little can be done to prevent aphasia. The extent of recovery, however, in some cases, can be affected by an individ- ual’s willingness to cooperate and participate in speech therapy directly following the injury. | No

7501 | NarrativeText | Aplastic anemia is a disorder in which the bone mar- row greatly decreases or stops production of blood cells. | No
7502 | Title | Description | No
7503 | NarrativeText | The bone marrow (soft tissue which is located with- in the hard outer shell of the bones) is responsible for the production of all the types of blood cells. The mature forms of these cells include red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body; white blood cells, which fight infection; and platelets, which are involved in clot- ting. In aplastic anemia, the basic structure of the marrow becomes abnormal, and those cells responsible for gener- ating blood cells (hematopoietic cells) are greatly decreased in number or absent. These hematopoietic cells are replaced by large quantities of fat. | No
7504 | NarrativeText | Yearly, aplastic anemia strikes about 5-10 people in every one million. Although aplastic anemia strikes both males and females of all ages, there are two age groups that have an increased risk. Both young adults (between 15-30 years of age) and the elderly (over the age of 60) have higher rates of aplastic anemia than the general population. While the disorder occurs worldwide, young adults in Asia have a higher disease rate than do popula- tions in North America and Europe. | No
7505 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7506 | NarrativeText | Aplastic anemia falls into three basic categories, based on the origin of its cause: idiopathic, acquired, and hereditary. | No
7507 | NarrativeText | In about 60% of cases, aplastic anemia is considered to be idiopathic, meaning that the cause of the disorder is unknown. | No
7508 | NarrativeText | Acquired aplastic anemia refers to those cases where certain environmental factors and physical conditions seem to be associated with development of the disease. Acquired aplastic anemia can be associated with: * exposure to drugs, especially anti-cancer agents, antibi- otics, anti-inflammatory agents, seizure medications, and antithyroid drugs (drugs given to stop the function- ing of an overactive thyroid) | No

7512 | NarrativeText | Hereditary aplastic anemia is relatively rare, but does occur in Fanconi’s anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and dyskeratosis congenita. | No
7513 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of aplastic anemia tend to be those of other anemias, including fatigue, weakness, tiny red- dish-purple marks (petechiae) on the skin (evidence of pinpoint hemorrhages into the skin), evidence of abnor- mal bruising, and bleeding from the gums, nose, intes- tine, or vagina. The patient is likely to appear pale. If the anemia progresses, decreased oxygen circulating in the blood may lead to an increase in heart rate and the sud- den appearance of a new heart murmur. | No
7514 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7515 | NarrativeText | The blood count in aplastic anemia will reveal low numbers of all formed blood cells. Red blood cells will appear normal in size and coloration, but greatly decreased in number. Cells called reticulocytes (very young red blood cells, which are usually produced in great numbers by the bone marrow in order to compen- sate for a severe anemia) will be very low in number. Platelets and white blood cells will also be decreased in number, though normal in structure. | No
7516 | NarrativeText | A sample of the patient’s bone marrow will need to be removed by needle (usually from the hip bone) and examined under a microscope. If aplastic anemia is pre- sent, this examination will reveal very few or no hematopoietic cells, and replacement with fat. | No
7517 | Title | Treatment | No
7518 | NarrativeText | The first step in the treatment of aplastic anemia involves discontinuing exposure to any substance that may be causing the disorder. Although it would seem that blood transfusions would be helpful in this disease, in fact, they only serve as a temporary help, and may com- plicate future attempts at bone marrow transplantation. | No
7519 | NarrativeText | The most successful treatment for aplastic anemia is bone marrow transplantation. To do this, a marrow donor (often a sibling) must be identified. There are a number of tissue markers which must be examined to determine whether a bone marrow donation is likely to be compatible with the patient’s immune system. Compatibility is neces- sary to avoid complications, including the destruction of the donor marrow by the patient’s own immune system. | No
7520 | NarrativeText | Patients who cannot undergo bone marrow trans- plant can be treated with a number of agents, including antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide, steroids, and cyclosporine. These agents all have the potential to cause a number of troublesome side-effects. Furthermore, not all patients respond fully to these agents. Still, even among those patients who do have a good response, many later suffer a relapse (return) of aplastic anemia. | No
7521 | Title | Prognosis | No
7522 | NarrativeText | Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening illness. Without treatment, it will almost surely progress to death. Sur- vival depends on how severe the disease is at diagnosis, which type of treatment a patient is eligible for, and what kind of response their body has to that treatment. The worst-prognosis type of aplastic anemia is one associated with very low numbers of a particular type of white blood cell. These patients have a high chance of dying from overwhelming bacterial infections. In fact, 830% of all patients treated with blood transfusions alone die within 18 months to two years. Patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation have a 60-90% chance of being cured of the disease. | No

7547 | Title | Description | No
7548 | NarrativeText | Appendectomy is considered a major surgical opera- tion. Therefore, a general surgeon must perform this operation in the operating room of a hospital. An anes- thesiologist is also present during the operation to admin- ister an anesthetic. Most often the anesthesiologist uses a general anesthetic technique whereby patients are put to sleep and made pain free by administering drugs in the vein or by agents inhaled through a tube placed in the windpipe. Occasionally a spinal anesthetic may be used. | No
7549 | NarrativeText | After the patient is anesthetized, the general surgeon can remove the appendix either by using the traditional open procedure (in which a 2-3 [5-7.6 cm] in incision is made in the abdomen) or via laparoscopy (in which four 1 in [2.5 cm] incisions are made in the abdomen). | No
7550 | Title | Traditional open appendectomy | No
7551 | NarrativeText | When the surgeon uses the open approach, he makes an incision in the lower right section of the abdomen. Most incisions are less than 3 in (7.6 cm) in length. The surgeon then identifies all of the organs in the abdomen and exam- ines them for other disease or abnormalities. The appendix is located and brought up into the wounds. The surgeon separates the appendix from all the surrounding tissue and its attachment to the cecum and then removes it. The site where the appendix was previously attached, the cecum, is closed and returned to the abdomen. The muscle layers and then the skin are sewn together. | No
7552 | Title | Laproscopic appendectomy | No
7553 | NarrativeText | When the surgeon conducts a laproscopic appendec- tomy, four incisions, each about 1 in (2.5 cm) in length, are made. One incision is near the umbilicus, or navel, and one is between the umbilicus and the pubis. Two other incisions are smaller and are in the right side of the lower abdomen. The surgeon then passes a camera and special instruments through these incisions. With the aid of this equipment, the surgeon visually examines the abdominal organs and identifies the appendix. Similarly, the appendix is freed from all of its attachments and removed. The place where the appendix was formerly attached, the cecum, is stitched. The appendix is removed through one of the incisions. The instruments are removed and then all of the incisions are closed. | No

The increased time required to do a LA increases the patient’s exposure to anesthetics, which increases the risk of complications. The increased time requirement also escalates fees charged by the hospital for operating room time and by the anesthesiologist. Since LA also requires specialized equipment, the fees for its use also increases the hospital charges. Patients with either opera- tion have similar pain medication needs, begin eating diets at comparable times, and stay in the hospital equiv- alent amounts of time. LA is of special benefit in women in whom the diagnosis is difficult and gynecological dis- ease (such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory dis- ease, ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian cysts, and tubal pregnancies) may be the source of pain and not appendicitis. If LA is done in these patients, the pelvic organs can be more thoroughly examined and a definitive diagnosis made prior to removal of the appendix. Most surgeons select either TA or LA based on the individual needs and circumstances of the patient. | No
7557 | NarrativeText | physicians. Hospital charges include fees for operating and recovery room use, diagnostic and laboratory testing, as well as the normal hospital room charges. Surgical fees vary from region to region and range between $250- $750. The anesthesiologist’s fee depends upon the health of the patient and the length of the operation. | No
7558 | Title | Preparation | No
7559 | NarrativeText | Once the diagnosis of appendicitis is made and the decision has been made to perform an appendectomy, the patient undergoes the standard preparation for an operation. This usually takes only one to two hours and includes sign- ing the operative consents, patient identification proce- dures, evaluation by the anesthesiologist, and moving the patient to the operating suites of the hospital. Occasionally, if the patient has been ill for a prolonged period of time or has had protracted vomiting, a delay of few to several hours may be necessary to give the patient fluids and antibiotics. | No

If patients tolerate this meal, the next meal usually is a regular diet. Patients are asked to walk and resume their normal physical activities as soon as possible. If TA was done, work and physical education classes may be restrict- ed for a full three weeks after the operation. If a LA was done, most patients are able to return to work and strenuous activity within one to three weeks after the operation. | No
7564 | Title | Risks | No
7565 | NarrativeText | Certain risks are present when any operation requires a general anesthetic and the abdominal cavity is opened. Pneumonia and collapse of the small airways (atelecta- sis) often occurs. Patients who smoke are at a greater risk for developing these complications. Thrombophlebitis, or inflammation of the veins, is rare but can occur if the patient requires prolonged bed rest. Bleeding can occur but rarely is a blood transfusion required. Adhesions (abnormal connections to abdominal organs by thin fibrous tissue) is a known complication of any abdominal procedure such as appendectomy. These adhesions can lead to intestinal obstruction which prevents the normal flow of intestinal contents. Hernia is a complication of any incision, However, they are rarely seen after appen- dectomy because the abdominal wall is very strong in the area of the standard appendectomy incision. | No
7566 | NarrativeText | The overall complication rate of appendectomy depends upon the status of the appendix at the time it is removed. If the appendix has not ruptured the complication rate is only about 3%. However, if the appendix has rup- tured the complication rate rises to almost 59%. Wound infections do occur and are more common if the appendici- tis was severe, far advanced, or ruptured. An abscess may form in the abdomen as a complication of appendicitis. | No
7567 | NarrativeText | Occasionally, an appendix will rupture prior to its removal, spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis or a generalized infection in the abdomen will occur. Treatment of peritonitis as a result of a rup- tured appendix includes removal of what remains of the appendix, insertion of drains (rubber tubes that promote the flow of infection inside the abdomen to outside of the body), and antibiotics. Fistula formation (an abnormal connection between the cecum and the skin) rarely occurs. It is only seen if the appendix has a broad attach- ment to the cecum and the appendicitis is far advanced causing destruction of the cecum itself. | No

7597 | NarrativeText | Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, which is the worm-shaped pouch attached to the cecum, the beginning of the large intestine. The appendix has no known function in the body, but it can become diseased. Appendicitis is a medical emergency, and if it is left untreated the appendix may rupture and cause a poten- tially fatal infection. | No
7598 | Title | Description | No
7599 | NarrativeText | Appendicitis is the most common abdominal emer- gency found in children and young adults. One person in 15 develops appendicitis in his or her lifetime. The inci- dence is highest among males aged 10-14, and among females aged 15-19. More males than females develop appendicitis between puberty and age 25. It is rare in the elderly and in children under the age of two. | No
7600 | NarrativeText | The hallmark symptom of appendicitis is increasing- ly severe abdominal pain. Since many different condi- tions can cause abdominal pain, an accurate diagnosis of appendicitis can be difficult. A timely diagnosis is impor- tant, however, because a delay can result in perforation, or rupture, of the appendix. When this happens, the infected contents of the appendix spill into the abdomen, potentially causing a serious infection of the abdomen called peritonitis. | No

7603 | NarrativeText | The treatment for acute (sudden, severe) appendici- tis is an appendectomy, surgery to remove the appendix. Because of the potential for a life-threatening ruptured appendix, persons suspected of having appendicitis are often taken to surgery before the diagnosis is certain. | No
7604 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7605 | NarrativeText | The causes of appendicitis are not well understood, but it is believed to occur as a result of one or more of these factors: an obstruction within the appendix, the development of an ulceration (an abnormal change in tis- sue accompanied by the death of cells) within the appen- dix, and the invasion of bacteria. | No
7606 | NarrativeText | Under these conditions, bacteria may multiply with- in the appendix. The appendix may become swollen and filled with pus (a fluid formed in infected tissue, consist- ing of while blood cells and cellular debris), and may eventually rupture. Signs of rupture include the presence of symptoms for more than 24 hours, a fever, a high white blood cell count, and a fast heart rate. Very rarely, | No

7608 | NarrativeText | the inflammation and symptoms of appendicitis may dis- appear but recur again later. | No
7609 | NarrativeText | The distinguishing symptom of appendicitis is pain beginning around or above the navel. The pain, which may be severe or only achy and uncomfortable, eventual- ly moves into the right lower corner of the abdomen. There, it becomes more steady and more severe, and often increases with movement, coughing, and so forth. The abdomen often becomes rigid and tender to the touch. Increasing rigidity and tenderness indicates an increased likelihood of perforation and peritonitis. | No
7610 | NarrativeText | Loss of appetite is very common. Nausea and yom- iting may occur in about half of the cases and occasion- ally there may be constipation or diarrhea. The temper- ature may be normal or slightly elevated. The presence of a fever may indicate that the appendix has ruptured. | No
7611 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7612 | NarrativeText | A careful examination is the best way to diagnose appendicitis. It is often difficult even for experienced physicians to distinguish the symptoms of appendicitis from those of other abdominal disorders. Therefore, very specific questioning and a thorough physical examina- tion are crucial. The physician should ask questions, such as where the pain is centered, whether the pain has shifted, and where the pain began. The physician should press on the abdomen to judge the location of the pain and the degree of tenderness. | No
7613 | NarrativeText | The typical sequence of symptoms is present in about 50% of cases. In the other half of cases, less typical pat- terns may be seen, especially in pregnant women, older patients, and infants. In pregnant women, appendicitis is easily masked by the frequent occurrence of mild abdom- inal pain and nausea from other causes. Elderly patients may feel less pain and tenderness than most patients, thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment, and leading to rupture in 30% of cases. Infants and young children often have diarrhea, vomiting, and fever in addition to pain. | No
7614 | NarrativeText | While laboratory tests cannot establish the diagno- sis, an increased white cell count may point to appendici- tis. Urinalysis may help to rule out a urinary tract infec- tion that can mimic appendicitis. | No
7615 | NarrativeText | Patients whose symptoms and physical examination are compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis are usual- ly taken immediately to surgery, where a laparotomy (surgical exploration of the abdomen) is done to confirm the diagnosis. In cases with a questionable diagnosis, other tests, such as a computed tomography scan (CT) may be performed to avoid unnecessary surgery. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen may help to identify an inflamed appendix or other condition that | No
7616 | Title | 342 | No
7617 | NarrativeText | would explain the symptoms. Abdominal x-rays are not of much value except when the appendix has ruptured. | No
7618 | NarrativeText | Often, the diagnosis is not certain until an operation is done. To avoid a ruptured appendix, surgery may be recom- mended without delay if the symptoms point clearly to appendicitis. If the symptoms are not clear, surgery may be postponed until they progress enough to confirm a diagnosis. | No
7619 | NarrativeText | When appendicitis is strongly suspected in a woman of child-bearing age, a diagnostic laparoscopy (an examination of the interior of the abdomen) is sometimes recommended before the appendectomy in order to be sure that a gynecological problem, such as a ruptured ovarian cyst, is not causing the pain. In this procedure, a lighted viewing tube is inserted into the abdomen through a small incision around the navel. | No
7620 | NarrativeText | A normal appendix is discovered in about 10-20% of patients who undergo laparotomy, because of suspected appendicitis. Sometimes the surgeon will remove a nor- mal appendix as a safeguard against appendicitis in the future. During the surgery, another specific cause for the pain and symptoms of appendicitis is found for about 30% of these patients. | No
7621 | Title | Treatment | No
7622 | NarrativeText | The treatment of appendicitis is an immediate appendectomy. This may be done by opening the abdomen in the standard open appendectomy technique, or through laparoscopy. In laparoscopy, a smaller inci- sion is made through the navel. Both methods can suc- cessfully accomplish the removal of the appendix. It is not certain that laparoscopy holds any advantage over open appendectomy. When the appendix has ruptured, patients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy may have to be switched to the open appendectomy procedure for the successful management of the rupture. If a rup- tured appendix is left untreated, the condition is fatal. | No
7623 | Title | Prognosis | No
7624 | NarrativeText | Appendicitis is usually treated successfully by appen- dectomy. Unless there are complications, the patient should recover without further problems. The mortality rate in cases without complications is less than 0.1%. When an appendix has ruptured, or a severe infection has developed, the likelihood is higher for complications, with slower recovery, or death from disease.

7643 | NarrativeText | Applied kinesiology (AK) is the study of muscles and the relationship of muscle strength to health. It incorporates a system of manual muscle testing and therapy. AK is based on the theory that an organ dys- function is accompanied by a specific muscle weakness. Diseases are diagnosed through muscle-testing proce- dures and then treated. AK is not the same as kinesiolo- gy, or biomechanics, which is the scientific study of movement. | No
7644 | Title | Purpose | No
7645 | NarrativeText | AK is not designed for crisis medicine. For example, an AK practitioner cannot cure cancer, arthritis, dia- betes, heart disease, or infections. This therapy is designed to be a part of a holistic approach to preventive medicine. The goals of AK are to (1) restore normal nerve function, (2) achieve normal endocrine, immune, digestive, and other internal organ functions, (3) inter- vene early in degenerative processes to prevent or delay pathological conditions, and to (4) restore postural bal- ance, correct gait (walking) impairment, and improve range of motion. | No

7647 | Title | Origins | No
7648 | NarrativeText | AK is based on principles of functional neurology, anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and biochemistry as well as principles from Chinese medicine, acupuncture, and massage. It was developed from traditional kinesiolo- gy in 1964 by George G. Goodheart, a chiropractor from Detroit, Michigan. He observed that each large muscle relates to a body organ. A weakness in a muscle may mean that there is a problem in the associated organ. Goodheart found that by treating the muscle and making it strong again, he was able to improve the function of the organ as well. For example, if a particular nutritional supplement was given to a patient, and the muscle tested strong, it was the correct supplement for the patient. If the muscle remained weak, it was not. Other methods of treatment can be evaluated in a similar manner. Goodheart also found that painful nodules (small bumps) may be associat- ed with a weak muscle. By deeply massaging the muscle, he was able to improve its strength. Goodheart’s findings in 1964 led to the origin and insertion treatment, the first method developed in AK. Other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were developed for various reflexes described by other chiropractors and doctors. Goodheart incorporat- ed acupuncture meridian therapy into AK after reading the writings of Felix Mann, M.D. | No
7649 | NarrativeText | Goodheart considered AK to be a therapeutic tool that incorporates feedback from the body. He said that “applied kinesiology is based on the fact that the body language never lies.” He felt that the body’s muscles were indicators of disharmony. Once muscle weakness has been ascertained, the problem may be solved in a variety of ways. If a practitioner approaches the problem correctly, he believed, making the proper and adequate diagnosis and treatment, the outcome is satisfactory both to the doctor and to the patient. | No

7651 | Title | GEORGE GOODHEART (1918 - ) | No
7652 | NarrativeText | Dr. George Goodheart was born in Detroit, Michi- gan, in 1918 and became a second-generation doctor of chiropractic. He graduated from the National College of Chiropractic in 1939 and is recognized as the founder and developer of Applied Kinesiology. After he joined the U.S. Air Force as an aviation cadet in World War II, he received a promotion to major at the age of 22. He was the youngest ever to attain that rank. He served in active duty from 1941-1946 and continued as a mem- ber of the Air Force Reserve until the mid-1950s. | No
7653 | NarrativeText | Dr. Goodheart held numerous positions of distinc- tion during his career, including director of the National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Company and director for the International College of Applied Kinesiology- U.S.A. He also lectured and taught throughout the Unit- ed States, Japan, Europe, and Australia; and he was the official doctor of chiropractic for the Lake Placed Winter Olympic Games in 1980. He contributes to a variety of trade publications on a regular basis. | No
7654 | NarrativeText | In 1998 Dr. Goodheart received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International College of Kinesiology. Earlier, in 1987 he was honored with the Leonardo da Vinci Award from the Institute for the Achievement of Human Potential, and he was cited for his research by Logan and Palmer Colleges of Chiro- practic. He represented the State of Michigan as a dele- gate to the American Chiropractic Association and was a fellow at the International College of Chiropractic. He resides with his wife, JoAnn in Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan, where he enjoys skiing and tennis. | No

The five areas of diagnosis and therapy for the applied kinesiologist are (1) the nervous system, (2) the lymphatic system, (3) the vascular (blood vessel) system, (4) the cerebrospinal sys- tem, and (5) the meridian system. | No
7656 | NarrativeText | The first part of AK is muscle testing, which is used to help diagnose what part of the body is functioning abnormally. Muscle testing involves putting the body into a position that requires a certain muscle to remain contracted, and then applying pressure against the mus- cle. The testing does not measure strength but is meant to reveal stresses and imbalances in the body through the tension in the muscle. The test evaluates the ability of a controlling system (like the nervous system) to adapt the muscle to meet the changing pressure of the examiner’s test. AK practitioners also examine structural factors such as posture, gait, and range of motion. Some chiro- practors use AK to help them evaluate the success of spinal adjustment. A leg muscle is tested for strength or weakness to determine whether the adjustments made are appropriate. | No
7657 | NarrativeText | According to AK, common internal causes of mus- cle weakness include: «dysfunction of nerve supply (nerve interference between spine and muscles) | No

7661 | ListItem | * excesses or deficiencies in nutrition Physiological reactions to chemicals, including those associated with nutrition and allergies, may also be evaluated using AK. The AK protocol for testing chemi- cal compounds is to place the substance on the patient’s tongue so that he tastes the material, and the normal chemical reactions of ingestion begin. In some cases, the substances are inhaled through the nose. The AK practi- tioner then tests the associated muscle-organ pattern to determine where or if there is a strength or weakness. The patient does not need to swallow the substance for a change in strength or weakness to be identified. David S. Walther, a diplomate of the International College of Applied Kinesiology, has indicated that “it is possible that the central nervous system, recognizing the com- pound being ingested, relays information to the organs and glands preparing for use of the compound. If the compound is recognized as beneficial, the energy pattern is immediately enhanced, influencing not only the organ or gland, but also the associated muscle.” | No

7706 | NarrativeText | The second part of AK involves the treatment phase. Goodheart and other practitioners of AK have adapted many treatment methods for the problems that are diag- nosed with muscle testing. Examples of treatment meth- ods include special diets, dietary supplements, chiro- practic manipulation, osteopathic cranial techniques, acupuncture/meridian therapies, acupressure, deep mus- cle massage, and nervous system coordination proce- dures. For example, an AK practitioner might treat asth- ma by looking for weaknesses in specific lower back and leg muscles that share a connection with the adrenal glands. The practitioner will strengthen these muscles and help the adrenal gland produce bronchodilators, chemicals that relax or open air passages in the lungs. | No
7707 | NarrativeText | The practice of kinesiology requires that it be used in conjunction with other standard diagnostic methods by professionals trained in clinical diagnosis. Most practi- tioners of AK are chiropractors, but naturopaths, medical doctors, dentists, osteopaths, nutritionists, physical thera- pists, massage therapists, podiatrists, psychiatrists, and nurse practitioners are also involved. In 1991, 37.2% of 4,835 full-time chiropractors in the United States who responded to a survey by the National Board of Chiro- practic Examiners (NBCE) said they used AK in their practice. Subsequent NBCE surveys indicated that 31% of chiropractors in Canada, 60% in Australia, and 72% in New Zealand use AK. | No
7708 | NarrativeText | Most practitioners of AK utilize a holistic approach and evaluate a person from a triad-based health perspec- tive. Generally, chiropractors approach health and heal- ing from a structural basis, medical doctors generally from a chemical basis, and psychiatrists and psycholo- gists from a mental or emotional basis. Applied kinesiol- ogists attempt to work with all three areas of health, and in some cases, include a spiritual dimension. | No
7709 | NarrativeText | The use of AK is often included in insurance cover- age if the policy covers chiropractor benefits. The cost of the AK examination is similar to the costs of other chiro- practic practices. | No
7710 | Title | Precautions | No
7711 | NarrativeText | AK should only by used by trained professionals with the necessary expertise to perform specific and accurate tests. The AK examination should be combined with a standard physical diagnosis, which often includes laboratory tests, x rays, health and dietary history, and other special tests. An AK examination should enhance a standard diagnosis, not replace it. The total diagnostic work-up should be used to determine the final diagnosis. | No
7712 | NarrativeText | The use of manual muscle testing to evaluate nutri- tion is particularly a problem if it is done by a lay nutri- tion sales person as a tool to sell his/her product. The per- son should have the educational background to evaluate nutritional needs as well as have a high level of knowl- edge in the use of proper muscle testing techniques. | No

7718 | NarrativeText | review published in 1999 by researchers from the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conserva- tive Therapies Research in Chapel Hill stated that, although AK appears to be a promising methodology, there is a lack of research results relevant to clinical practice and outcomes of AK care. They found this lack of results surprising, since cost, satisfaction, uti- lization, and changes in symptoms are the important results of clinical practice. In addition, they determined that some studies that were supposed to be an evalua- tion of AK procedures did not actually use clinical practices and principles of AK. However, from studies adhering to AK principles and employing standardized training by well-trained practitioners, they did state there was some evidence that AK is an objectively veri- fiable phenomenon. They suggested that “future stud- ies of AK should focus on outcomes of care, including symptoms, function, costs, and safety. Only well- designed studies that account for the individual nature of AK diagnosis and treatment and preserve the proper clinical context of AK treatment will be informative. Understanding the individual components of the process of AK treatment remains important. Studies addressing validation of isolated AK procedures need to meet the methodological challenges of studying appropriate subjects that reflects the current recog- nized practice and understanding of AK. Further evalu- ation of the basic physiologic phenomena involved and correlation of AK manual muscle test results will also advance understanding of this diagnostic and therapeu- tic system.” | No

7730 | NarrativeText | Encephalitis is a serious inflammation of the brain. Arbovirus encephalitis is caused by a virus from the Arbovirus group. The term arbovirus stands for Arthro- pod-borne virus because these viruses are passed to humans by members of the phylum Arthropoda (which includes insects and spiders). | No
7731 | Title | Description | No
7732 | NarrativeText | Of the huge number of arboviruses known to exist, about 80 types are responsible for human disease. In addition to the virus, there are usually two other types of living creatures involved in the cycle leading to human disease. When large quantities of virus are present in an arthropod (often a tick or mosquito), the viruses are passed to a bird or small mammal when the arthropod attempts to feed on the blood of that creature. The virus thrives within the new host, sometimes causing illness, sometimes not. More ticks or mosquitoes are infected with the virus when they feed on the host’s blood. Even- tually, a tick or mosquito bites a human, and the virus is passed along. Just a few types of arboviruses cycle only between arthropods and humans, with no intermediate stop in a bird or small mammal. | No
7733 | NarrativeText | Because the arboviruses require an arthropod to pass them along to humans, the most common times of year for these illnesses include summer and fall, when mos- quitoes and ticks are most prevalent. Damp environments favor large populations of mosquitoes, and thus also increase the risk of arbovirus infections. | No
7734 | NarrativeText | The major causes of arbovirus encephalitis include the members of the viral families alphavirus (causing Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis), flavivirus (respon- sible for St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Tick-borne encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, Russian spring-summer encephalitis, and Powassan), and bunyavirus (causing California encephalitis). | No
7735 | NarrativeText | In the United States, the most important types of arbovirus encephalitis include Western equine encephali- tis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), St. Louis encephalitis, and California encephalitis. WEE strikes young infants in particular, with a 5% chance of death from the illness. Of those who survive, about 60% suffer permanent brain damage. EEE strikes infants and chil- dren, with a 20% chance of death, and a high rate of per- manent brain damage among survivors. St. Louis encephalitis tends to strike adults older than 40 years of age, and older patients tend to have higher rates of death and long-term disability from the infection. California virus primarily strikes 5-18 year olds, with a lower degree of permanent brain damage. | No
7736 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7737 | NarrativeText | Encephalitis occurs because specific arboviruses have biochemical characteristics which cause them to be particularly attracted to the cells of the brain and the nerves. The virus causes cell death and inflammation, with fever and swelling within the brain and nerves. The membranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges) may also become inflamed, a condition called meningitis. The brain is swollen, and patches of bleed- ing occur throughout the brain and spinal cord. | No
7738 | NarrativeText | Patients with encephalitis suffer from headaches, fever, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck, and sleepiness. As the disease progresses, more severe symptoms devel- op, including tremors, confusion, seizures, coma, and paralysis. Loss of function occurs when specific nerve areas are damaged and/or killed. | No
7739 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7740 | NarrativeText | Early in the disease, laboratory testing of blood may reveal the presence of the arbovirus. The usual technique used to verify the presence of arbovirus involves injecting the patient’s blood into the brain of a newborn mouse, then waiting to see if the mouse develops encephalitis. Diagnosis is usually based on the patient’s symptoms, history of tick or mosquito bites, and knowledge that the patient has been in an area known to harbor the arbovirus. | No
7741 | Title | Treatment | No
7742 | NarrativeText | Treatment is mostly supportive, meaning it is direct- ed at improving the symptoms, but does not shorten the course of the illness. The main concerns of treatment involve lowering fever, treating pain, avoiding dehydra- tion or other chemical imbalances, and decreasing swelling in the brain with steroids. | No
7743 | Title | Prognosis | No
7744 | NarrativeText | Prognosis depends on the particular type of arbovirus causing disease, and on the age and prior health status of the patient. Death rates range all the way up to 20% for arbovirus encephalitis, and the rates of lifelong effects due to brain damage reach 60% for some types of arboviruses. | No

As early as 1500 B.c. the ancient Egyptians used waters, oils, incense, resins, and ointments scented with botanicals for their religious ceremonies. | No
7768 | NarrativeText | There is evidence that the Chinese may have recog- nized the benefits of herbal and aromatic remedies much earlier than this. The oldest known herbal text, Shen Nung’s Pen Ts’ ao (c. 2700-3000 B.c.) catalogs over 200 botanicals. Ayurveda, a practice of traditional Indian medicine that dates back over 2,500 years, also used aro- matic herbs for treatment. | No
7769 | NarrativeText | The Romans were well-known for their use of fra- grances. They bathed with botanicals and integrated them into their state and religious rituals. So did the Greeks, with a growing awareness of the medicinal prop- erties of herbs, as well. Greek physician and surgeon Pedanios Dioscorides, whose renown herbal text De Materia Medica (60 A.D.) was the standard textbook for Western medicine for 1,500 years, wrote extensively on the medicinal value of botanical aromatics. The Medica contained detailed information on over 500 plants and 4,740 separate medicinal uses for them, including an entire section on aromatics. | No
7770 | NarrativeText | Written records of herbal distillation are found as early as the first century A.D., and around 1000 a.D., the noted Arab physician and naturalist Avicenna described the distil- lation of rose oil from rose petals, and the medicinal prop- erties of essential oils in his writings. However, it wasn’t until 1937, when French chemist René-Maurice Gattefossé published Aromatherapie: Les Huiles essentielles, hor- mones végé tales, that aromatherapie, or aromatherapy, was introduced in Europe as a medical discipline. Gattefossé, who was employed by a French perfumeur, discovered the healing properties of lavender oil quite by accident when he suffered a severe burn while working and used the clos- est available liquid, lavender oil, to soak it in. | No
7771 | NarrativeText | In the late 20th century, French physician Jean Valnet used botanical aromatics as a front line treatment for wounded soldiers in World War II. He wrote about his use of essential oils and their healing and antiseptic properties, in his 1964 book Aromatherapie, traitement des maladies par les essences des plantes, which popularized the use of essential oils for medical and psychiatric treatment through- out France. Later, French biochemist Mauguerite Maury popularized the cosmetic benefits of essential oils, and in 1977 Robert Tisserand wrote the first English language book on the subject, The Art of Aromatherapy, which intro- duced massage as an adjunct treatment to aromatherapy and sparked its popularity in the United Kingdom. | No
7772 | NarrativeText | In aromatherapy, essential oils are carefully selected for their medicinal properties. As essential oils are absorbed into the bloodstream through application to the skin or inhalation, their active components trigger certain pharmalogical effects (e.g., pain relief). | No

The volatility of an oil, or the speed at which it evaporates in open air, is thought to be linked to the specific psychological effect of an oil.

7798 | NarrativeText | Because of their potency, essential oils are diluted in a carrier oil or lotion before being applied to the skin to prevent an allergic skin reaction. The carrier oil can be a vegetable or olive based one, such as wheat germ or avo- cado. Light oils, such as safflower, sweet almond, grape- seed, hazelnut, apricot seed, or peach kernel, may be absorbed more easily by the skin. Standard dilutions of essential oils in carrier oils range from 2-10%. However, some oils can be used at higher concentrations, and oth- ers should be diluted further for safe and effective use. The type of carrier oil used and the therapeutic use of the application may also influence how the essential oil is mixed. Individuals should seek guidance from a health- As non-prescription botanical preparations, the essential oils used in aromatherapy are typically not paid for by health insurance. The self-administered nature of the therapy controls costs to some degree. Aromatherapy treatment sessions from a professional aromatherapist are not covered by health insurance in most cases, although aromatherapy performed in conjunction with physical therapy, nursing, therapeutic massage, or other covered medical services may be.

7840 | NarrativeText | An arrhythmia is an abnormality in the heart’s rhythm, or heartbeat pattern. The heartbeat can be too slow, too fast, have extra beats, skip a beat, or otherwise beat irregularly. | No
7841 | Title | Description | No
7842 | NarrativeText | Arrhythmias are deviations from the normal cadence of the heartbeat, which cause the heart to pump improp- erly. The normal heartbeat starts in the right atrium, where the heart’s natural pacemaker (the sinus node) sends an electrical signal to the center of the heart to the atrioventricular node. The atrioventricular node then sends signals into the main pumping chamber to make the ventricle contract. Arrhythmias occur when the heart- beat starts in a part of the heart other than the sinus node, an abnormal rate or rhythm develops in the sinus node, or a heart conduction “block” prevents the electrical signal from traveling down the normal pathway. | No
7843 | NarrativeText | More than four million Americans have arrhythmias, most of which are harmless. Middle-aged adults common- ly experience arrhythmias. As people age, the probability of experiencing an arrhythmia increases. Arrhythmias often occur in people who do not have heart disease. In people with heart disease, it is usually the heart disease which is dangerous, not the arrhythmia. Arrhythmias often occur during and after heart attacks. Some types of arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, are serious and even life threatening. In the United States, arrhythmias are the primary cause of sudden cardiac death, account- ing for more than 350,000 deaths each year. | No
7844 | NarrativeText | Slow heart rates (less than 60 beats per minute) are called bradycardias, while fast heart rates (more than 100 beats per minute) are called tachycardias. Bradycardia can result in poor circulation of blood, and, hence, a lack of oxygen throughout the body, especially the brain. Tachycardias also can compromise the heart’s ability to pump effectively because the ventricles do not have enough time to completely fill. | No
7845 | NarrativeText | Arrhythmias are characterized by their site of origin: the atria or the ventricles. Supraventricular arrhythmias occur in the upper areas of the heart and are less serious than ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillation is the most serious arrhythmia and is fatal unless medical help is immediate. | No
7846 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7847 | NarrativeText | In many cases, the cause of an arrhythmia is unknown. Known causes of arrhythmias include heart disease, stress, caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, diet pills, and decongestants in cough and cold medicines. | No
7848 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of an arrhythmia include a fast heartbeat, pounding or fluttering chest sensations, skipping a heart- beat, “flip-flops,” dizziness, faintness, shortness of breath, and chest pains. | No
7849 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7850 | NarrativeText | Examination with a stethoscope, electrocardio- grams, and electrophysiologic studies is used to diagnose arrhythmias. Sometimes arrhythmias can be identified by listening to the patient’s heart through a stethoscope, but, since arrhythmias are not always present, they may not occur during the physical exam. | No
7851 | NarrativeText | An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen from poor circu- lation (ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs. They send impulses of the heart’s activity through an electrical activity monitor (oscilloscope) to a recorder that traces them on paper. The test takes about 10 min- utes and is performed in a physician’s office. Another type of ECG, commonly known as the exercisestress test, measures how the heart and blood vessels respond to exertion while the patient is exercising on a treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in a physi- cian’s office or an exercise laboratory and takes 15-30 minutes. Other types of ECGs include 24-hour ECG monitoring and transtelephonic monitoring. In 24-hour ECG (Holter) monitoring, the patient wears a small, portable tape recorder connected to disks on his/her chest that record the heart’s rhythm during daily activities. Transtelephonic monitoring can identify arrhythmias that occur infrequently. Similar to Holter monitoring, transtelephonic monitoring can continue for days or weeks, and it enables patients to send the ECG via tele- phone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia is felt, or the patient can store the information in the recorder and transmit it later. | No
7852 | NarrativeText | Electrophysiologic studies are invasive procedures performed in a hospital to identify the origin of serious arrhythmias and responses to various treatments. They involve cardiac catheterization, in which catheters tipped with electrodes are passed from a vein in the arm or leg through the blood vessels into the heart. The elec- trodes record impulses in the heart, highlighting where the arrhythmia starts. During the procedure, physicians can test the effects of various drugs by provoking an arrhythmia through the electrodes and trying different drugs. The procedure takes one to three hours, during which the patient is awake but mildly sedated. Local anesthetic is injected at the catheter insertion sites. | No
7853 | Title | Treatment | No
7854 | NarrativeText | Many arrhythmias do not require any treatment. For serious arrhythmias, treating the underlying heart disease sometimes controls the arrhythmia. In some cases, the arrhythmia itself is treated with drugs, electrical shock (car- dioversion), automatic implantable defibrillators, artificial pacemakers, catheter ablation, or surgery. Supraventricu- lar arrhythmias often can be treated with drug therapy. Ven- tricular arrhythmias are more complex to treat. | No
7855 | NarrativeText | Drug therapy can manage many arrhythmias, but finding the right drug and dose requires care and can take some time. Common drugs for suppressing arrhythmias include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, quini- dine, digitalis preparations, and procainamide. Because of their potential serious side effects, stronger, desensi- tizing drugs are used only to treat life-threatening arrhythmias. All of the drugs used to treat arrhythmias have possible side effects, ranging from mild complica- tions with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers to more serious effects of desensitizing drugs that can, para- doxically, cause arrhythmias or make them worse. Response to drugs is usually measured by ECG, Holter monitor, or electrophysiologic study. | No
7856 | NarrativeText | In emergency situations, cardioversion or defibrilla- tion (the application of an electrical shock to the chest wall) is used. Cardioversion restores the heart to its nor- mal rhythm. It is followed by drug therapy to prevent recurrence of the arrhythmia. | No
7857 | NarrativeText | Artificial pacemakers that send electrical signals to make the heart beat properly can be implanted under the skin during a simple operation. Leads from the pacemak- er are anchored to the right side of the heart. Pacemakers are used to correct bradycardia and are sometimes used after surgical or catheter ablation. | No
7858 | NarrativeText | Automatic implantable defibrillators correct life- threatening ventricular arrhythmias by recognizing them and then restoring a normal heart rhythm by pacing the heart or giving it an electric shock. They are implanted within the chest wall without major surgery and store information for future evaluation by physicians. Auto- matic implantable defibrillators have proven to be more effective in saving lives than drugs alone. They often are used in conjunction with drug therapy. | No
7859 | NarrativeText | Ablation, a procedure to alter or remove the heart tissue causing the arrhythmia in order to prevent a recur- rence, can be performed through a catheter or surgery. Supraventricular tachycardia can be treated successfully with ablation. Catheter ablation is performed in a catheterization laboratory with the patient under seda- tion. A catheter equipped with a device that maps the heart’s electrical pathways is inserted into a vein and is threaded into the heart. High-frequency radio waves are then used to remove the pathway(s) causing the arrhyth- mia. Surgical ablation is similar in principle but it is per- formed in a hospital, using a cold probe instead of radio waves to destroy tissue. Ablation treatments are used when medications fail. | No
7860 | NarrativeText | Maze surgery treats atrial fibrillation by making multiple incisions through the atrium to allow electrical impulses to move effectively. This is often recommended for patients who have not responded to drugs or car- dioversion. | No
7861 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
7862 | NarrativeText | Since some arrhythmias can be life threatening, a conventional medical doctor should always be consulted first. Acupuncture can correct an insignificant number (1.5%) of atrial fibrillation cases. For new, minor arrhyth- mias, acupuncture may be effective in up to 70% of cases, but this figure may not differ much from placebo therapy. Both western and Chinese herbal remedies are also used in the treatment of arrhythmias. Since hawthorn (Cratae- gus laevigata) dilates the blood vessels and stimulates the heart muscle, it may help to stabilize arrhythmias. It is gentle and appropriate for home use, unlike foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), an herb whose action on the heart is too potent for use without supervision by a qualified prac- titioner. Homeopathic practitioners may prescribe reme- dies such as Lachesis and aconite or monkshood (Aconi- tum napellus) to treat mild arrhythmias. | No
7863 | Title | Prognosis | No
7864 | NarrativeText | Advances in diagnostic techniques, new drugs, and medical technology have extended the lives of many patients with serious arrhythmias.

7889 | Title | Description | No
7890 | NarrativeText | When a blood clot develops in an artery and remains in place, it is called a thrombosis. If all or part of the blockage breaks away and lodges in another part of the artery, it is called an embolism. Blockage of an artery in this manner can be the result of a blood clot, fat cells, or an air bubble. | No
7891 | NarrativeText | When an embolus blocks the flow of blood in an artery, the tissues beyond the plug are deprived of normal blood flow and oxygen. This can cause severe damage and even death of the tissues involved. | No
7892 | NarrativeText | Emboli can affect any part of the body. The most common sites are the legs and feet. When the brain is affected, it is called a stroke. When the heart is involved, it is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction (MI). | No
7893 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7894 | NarrativeText | A common cause of embolus is when an artery whose lining has become thickened or damaged, usually with age, allows cholesterol to build up more easily than normal on the artery wall. If some of the cholesterol breaks off, it forms an embolus. Emboli also commonly form from blood clots in a heart that has been damaged from heart attack or when the heart contracts abnormally from arterial fibrillation. | No
7895 | NarrativeText | Other known causes are fat cells that enter the blood after a major bone fracture, infected blood cells, cancer cells that enter the blood stream, and small gas bubbles. | No
7896 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of an embolus can begin suddenly or build slowly over time, depending on the amount of blocked blood flow. | No
7897 | NarrativeText | If the embolus is in an arm or leg, there will be mus- cle pain, numbness or tingling, pale skin color, lower temperature in the limb, and weakness or loss of muscle function. If it occurs in an internal organ, there is usually pain and/or loss of the organ’s function. | No

In this procedure, a colored liquid mate- rial (a dye, or contrast material) that can be seen with x rays is injected into the blood stream through a small tube called a catheter. As the dye fills the arteries, they are easily seen on x ray motion pictures. If there is a blockage in the artery, it shows up as a sudden cut off in the movement of contrast material. Angiography is an expensive procedure and does carry some risk. The catheter may cause a blood clot to form, blocking blood flow. There is also the risk of poking the catheter through the artery or heart muscle. Some people may be allergic to the dye. The risk of any of these injuries occurring is small. | No

Following the release of oxygen in the tissues, the blood returns to the heart in veins. An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal con- nection of an artery and a vein. The blood bypasses the cap- illaries and tissues, and returns to the heart. Arterial blood has a higher blood pressure than veins and causes swelling of veins involved in a fistula. Although both the artery and the vein retain their normal connections, the new opening between the two will cause some arterial blood to shunt into the vein because of the blood pressure difference. | No
7928 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7929 | NarrativeText | There are two types of arteriovenous fistulas, congen- ital and acquired. A congenital arteriovenous fistula is one that formed during fetal development. It is a birth defect. | No

7932 | NarrativeText | Congenital—Present at the time of birth. | No
7933 | NarrativeText | In congenital fistulas, blood vessels of the lower extremity are more frequently involved than other areas of the body. Congenital fistulas are not common. An acquired arteri- ovenous fistula is one that develops after a person is born. It usually occurs when an artery and vein that are side-by- side are damaged and the healing process results in the two becoming linked. After catheterizations, arteriovenous fistulas may occur as a complication of the arterial punc- ture in the leg or arm. Fistulas also form without apparent cause. In the case of patients on hemodialysis, physicians perform surgery to create a fistula. These patients receive many needle sticks to flush their blood through dialysis machines and for routine blood analysis testing. The veins used may scar and become difficult to use. Surgery is used to connect an artery and vein so that arterial blood pressure and flow rate widens the vein and decreases the chance of blood clots forming inside the vein. | No
7934 | NarrativeText | The main symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas near the surface of the skin are bulging and discolored veins. In some cases, the bulging veins can be mistaken for varicose veins. Other fistulas can cause more serious problems depending on their location and the blood ves- sels involved. | No
7935 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7936 | NarrativeText | Using a stethoscope, a physician can detect the sound of a pulse in the affected vein (bruit). The sound is a distinctive to-and-fro sound. Dye into the blood can be tracked by x ray to confirm the presence of a fistula. | No
7937 | Title | Treatment | No
7938 | NarrativeText | Small arteriovenous fistulas can be corrected by surgery. Fistulas in the brain or eye are very difficult to treat. If surgery is not possible or very difficult, injection therapy may be used. Injection therapy is the injection of substances that cause the blood to clot at the site of the injection. In the case of an arteriovenous fistula, the blood clot should stop the passage of blood from the artery to the vein. Surgery is usually used to correct acquired fistulas once they are diagnosed. | No

7947 | NarrativeText | Arteriovenous malformations are blood vessel defects that occur before birth when the fetus is growing in the uterus (prenatal development). The blood vessels appear as a tangled mass of arteries and veins. They do not possess the capillary (very fine blood vessels) bed which normally exists in the common area where the arteries and veins lie in close proximity (artery-vein interface). An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may hemorrhage, or bleed, leading to serious complications that can be life-threatening. | No
7948 | Title | Description | No
7949 | NarrativeText | AVMs represent an abnormal interface between arteries and veins. Normally, arteries carry oxygenated blood to the body’s tissues through progressively smaller blood vessels. The smallest are capillaries, which form a web of blood vessels (the capillary bed) through the body’s tissues. The arterial blood moves through tissues by these tiny pathways, exchanging its load of oxygen and nutrients for carbon dioxide and other waste products produced by the body cells (cellular wastes). The blood is carried away by progressively larger blood vessels, the veins. AVMs lack a capillary bed and arterial blood is moved (shunted) directly from the arteries into the veins. | No
7950 | NarrativeText | AVMs can occur anywhere in the body and have been found in the arms, hands, legs, feet, lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. However, 50% of these malformations are locat- ed in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Owing to the possibility of hemorrhaging, such AVMs carry the risk of stroke, paralysis, and the loss of speech, memory, or vision. An AVM that hemorrhages can be fatal. | No
7951 | NarrativeText | Approximately three of every 100,000 people have a cerebral AVM and roughly 40-80% of them will experi- ence some bleeding from the abnormal blood vessels at some point. The annual risk of an AVM bleeding is esti- mated at about 1-4%. After age 55, the risk of bleeding decreases. Pre-existing high blood pressure or intense physical activity do not seem to be associated with AVM Arteriovenous malformations. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.) | No
7952 | NarrativeText | hemorrhage, but pregnancy and labor could cause a rup- ture or breaking open of a blood vessel. An AVM hemor- thage is not as dangerous as an aneurysmal rupture. (An aneurysm is a swollen, blood filled vessel where the pressure of the blood causes the wall to bulge outward.) There is an approximate 10% fatality rate associated with AVM hemorrhage, compared to a 50% fatality rate for ruptured aneurysms. | No
7953 | NarrativeText | Although AVMs are congenital defects, meaning a person is born with them, they are rarely discovered before age 20. A genetic link has been proposed for some AVMs, but studies are only suggestive, not positive. The majority of AVMs are discovered in people age 20-40. Medical researchers estimate that the malformations are created during days 45-60 of fetal development. A sec- ond theory suggests that AVMs are primitive structures that are left over from the period when fetal blood circu- lating systems began to develop. | No
7954 | NarrativeText | However they form, AVMs have blood vessels that are abnormally fragile. The arteries that feed into the malformation are unusually swollen and thin walled. They lack the usual amount of smooth muscle tissue and elastin, a fibrous connective tissue. These blood vessels commonly accumulate deposits of calcium salts and hyalin. The venous part of the malformation receives blood directly from the artery. Without the intervening capillary bed, the veins receive blood at a higher pressure than they were designed to handle. This part of the mal- formation is also swollen (dilated) and thin walled. There is a measurable risk of an aneurysm forming near an AVM, increasing the threat of hemorrhage, brain dam- age, and death. Approximately 10-15% of AVMs are accompanied by saccular aneurysms, a type of aneurysm that looks like a small sac attached to the outer wall of the blood vessel. | No
7955 | NarrativeText | Although the malformation itself lacks capillaries, there is often an abnormal proliferation of capillaries next to the defect. These blood vessels feed into the mal- formation, causing it to grow larger in some cases. As the AVM receives more blood through this “steal,” adjacent brain tissue does not receive enough. These areas show abnormal nerve cell growth, cell death, and deposits of calcium in that area (calcification). Nerve cells within the malformation may demonstrate abnormal growth and are believed to be nonfunctional. | No
7956 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
7957 | NarrativeText | Most people do not realize that they have an AVM unless it hemorrhages enough to produce symptoms. Small AVMs are more likely to hemorrhage. If a hemor- rhage occurs, it produces a sudden, severe headache. The headache may be focused in one specific area or it may be more general. It can be mistaken for a migraine in some cases. The headache is accompanied by other symptoms, such as vomiting, a stiff neck, sleepiness, lethargy, confusion, irritability, or weakness anywhere in the body. Seizures occur in about a quarter of AVM cases. A person may experience decreased, double, or blurred vision. Hemorrhaging from an AVM is generally less dangerous than hemorrhaging from an aneurysm, with a survival rate of 80-90%. | No
7958 | NarrativeText | Other symptoms occur less frequently, but some- times appear alongside major symptoms such as the sud- den severe headache. Additional warning signs of a bleeding AVM are impaired speech or smell, fainting, facial paralysis, a drooping eyelid, dizziness, and ringing or buzzing in the ears. | No
7959 | NarrativeText | Although large AVMs are less likely to hemorrhage, they can induce symptoms based on their mass alone. Large AVMs exert pressure against brain tissue, cause abnormal development in the surrounding brain tissue, and slow down or block blood flow. Hydrocephalus, a swelling of brain tissue caused by accumulated fluids, may develop. The warning signs associated with a large non-bleeding AVM are similar to the symptoms of a small malformation that is bleeding. Unexplained headaches, seizures, dizziness, and neurological symp- toms, such as sensory changes, are signals that demand medical attention. | No
7960 | Title | Diagnosis | No
7961 | NarrativeText | Based on the clinical symptoms such as severe headache and neurological problems, and after a com- plete neurologic exam, a computed tomography scan (CT) of the head will be done. In some cases, a whoosh- ing sound from arteries in the neck or over the eye or jaw (called a bruit), can be heard with a stethoscope. The CT | No
7962 | Title | 358 | No
7963 | NarrativeText | scan will reveal whether there has been bleeding in the brain and can identify AVMs larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also used to identify an AVM. A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may follow the MRI or CT scan. A lumbar puncture involves removing a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from the lower part of the spine. Blood cells or blood breakdown products in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate bleeding. | No
7964 | NarrativeText | To pinpoint where the blood is coming from, a cere- bral angiography is done. This procedure uses x rays to map out the blood vessels in the brain, including the ves- sels that feed into the malformation. The information gained from angiography complements the MRI and helps distinguish the precise location of the AVM. | No
7965 | Title | Treatment | No
7966 | NarrativeText | Neurosurgeons consider several factors before deciding on a treatment option. There is some debate over whether or not to treat AVMs that have not rup- tured and are not causing any symptoms. The risks and benefits of proceeding with treatment need to be mea- sured on an individual basis, taking into account factors such as the person’s age and general health, as well as the AVM’s size and location. Several treatment options are available, both for symptomatic or asymptomatic AVMs. These treatment options may be used alone or in combination. | No
7967 | Title | Surgery | No
7968 | NarrativeText | Removing the AVM is the surest way of preventing it from causing future problems. Both small and large AVMs can be handled in surgery. Surgery is recommend- ed for superficial AVMs, but may be too dangerous for deep or very large AVMs. Unless it is an emergency situ- ation, an AVM that has hemorrhaged is treated conserva- tively for several weeks. Conservative treatment consists of managing the immediate symptoms and allowing the patient’s condition to stabilize. Surgery requires general anesthesia and a longer period of recuperation than any other treatment option. | No
7969 | Title | Radiation | No
7970 | NarrativeText | Radiation is particularly useful to treat small (under 1 in) malformations that are deep within the brain. Ioniz- ing radiation is directed at the malformation, destroying the AVM without damaging the surrounding tissue. Radi- ation treatment is accomplished in a single session and it is not necessary to open the skull. However, success can only be measured over the course of the following two years. A year after the procedure, 50-75% of treated AVMs are completely blocked; two years after radiation treatment, the percentage increases to 85-95%. | No

7978 | Title | Embolization | No
7979 | NarrativeText | Embolization involves plugging up access to the mal- formation. This technique does not require opening the skull to expose the brain and can be used to treat deep AVMs. Using x-ray images as a guide, a catheter is threaded through the artery in the thigh (femoral artery) to the affected area. The patient remains awake during the procedure and medications can be administered to pre- vent discomfort. The blood vessel leading into the AVM is assessed for its importance to the rest of the brain before a balloon or other blocking agent is inserted via the catheter. The block chokes off the blood supply to the malformation. There may be a mild headache or nausea associated with the procedure, but patients may resume normal activities after leaving the hospital. At least two to three embolization procedures are usually necessary at intervals of two to six weeks. At least a three-day hospital stay is associated with each embolization. | No
7980 | Title | Prognosis | No
7981 | NarrativeText | Approximately 10% of AVM cases are fatal. Seizures and neurological changes may be permanent in another 10-30% cases of AVM rupture. If an AVM bleeds once, it is about 20% likely to bleed again in the next year. As time passes from the initial hemorrhage, the risk for fur- ther bleeding drops to about 3-4%. If the AVM has not bled, it is possible, but not guaranteed, that it never will. Untreated AVMs can grow larger over time and rarely go away by themselves. Once an AVM is removed and a per- son has recovered from the procedure, there should be no further symptoms associated with that malformation. | No

8003 | Title | Description | No
8004 | NarrativeText | Arthrograpy may be referred to as “‘joint radiography” or “x rays of the joint.” The term arthrogram may be used interchangeably with arthrography. The joint area will be cleaned and a local anesthetic will be injected into the tis- sues around the joint to reduce pain. Next, if fluids are pre- sent in the joint, the physician may suction them out (aspi- rate) with a needle. These fluids may be sent to a laborato- ry for further study. Contrast agents are then injected into the joint through the same location by attaching the aspi- rating needle to a syringe containing the contrast medium. The purpose of contrast agents in x-ray procedures is to help highlight details of areas under study by making them opaque. Agents for arthrography are generally air and water-soluble dyes, the most common containing iodine. Air and iodine may be used together or independently. After the contrast agent is administered, the site of injec- tion will be sealed and the patient may be asked to move the joint around to distribute the contrast. | No

Sometimes, the patient will experience some tingling or discomfort during the procedure, which is normal and due to the contrast. Following fluoroscopic tracking of the contrast, standard x rays of the area may also be taken. The entire procedure will last about one hour. | No
8008 | Title | Preparation | No
8009 | NarrativeText | It is important to discuss any known sensitivity to local anesthetics or iodine prior to this procedure. A physician should explain the procedure and the risks associated with contrast agents and ask the patient to sign an informed consent. If iodine contrast will be adminis- tered, the patient may be instructed not to eat before the exam. The timeframe of fasting may extend from only 90 minutes prior to the exam up to the night before. There is no other preparation necessary. | No
8010 | Title | Aftercare | No
8011 | NarrativeText | The affected joint should be rested for approximate- ly 12 hours following the procedure. The joint may be wrapped in an elastic bandage and the patient should receive instructions on the care and changing of the ban- dage. Noises in the joint such as cracking or clicking are normal for a few days following arthrography. These noises are the result of liquid in the joints. Swelling may also occur and can be treated with application of ice or cold packs. A mild pain reliever can be used to lessen pain in the first few days. However, if any of these symp- toms persist for more than a few days, patients are advised to contact their physician. | No
8012 | Title | Risks | No
8013 | NarrativeText | In some patients iodine can cause allergic reactions, ranging from mild nausea to severe cardiovascular or nervous system complications. Since the contrast dye is put into a joint, rather than into a vein, allergic reactions are rare. Facilities licensed to perform contrast exams should meet requirements for equipment, supplies and staff training to handle a possible severe reaction. Infec- tion or joint damage are possible, although not frequent, complications of arthrography. | No

8034 | Title | Purpose | No
8035 | NarrativeText | The goal of arthroplasty is to restore the function of a stiffened joint and relieve pain. Two types of arthroplastic surgery exist. Joint resection involves removing a portion of the bone from a stiffened joint, creating a gap between the bone and the socket, to improve the range of motion. Scar tissue eventually fills the gap. Pain is relieved and motion is restored, but the joint is less stable. | No
8036 | NarrativeText | Interpositional reconstruction is surgery to reshape the joint and add a prosthetic disk between the two bones forming the joint. The prosthesis can be made of plastic and metal or from body tissue such as fascia and skin. When interpositional reconstruction fails, total joint replacement may be necessary. Joint replacement is also called total joint arthroplasty. | No

8072 | NarrativeText | In arthroscopic surgery, an orthopedic surgeon uses an arthroscope, a fiber-optic instrument, to see the inside of a joint. After making an incision about the size of a buttonhole in the patient’s skin, a sterile sodium chloride solution is injected to distend the joint. The arthroscope, an instrument the size of a pencil, is then inserted into the joint. The arthroscope has a lens and a lighting system through which the structures inside the joint are transmit- ted to a miniature television camera attached to the end of the arthroscope. The surgeon uses irrigation and suc- tion to remove blood and debris from the joint before examining it. Other incisions may be made in order to see other parts of the joint or to insert additional instru- ments. Looking at the interior of the joint on the televi- sion screen, the surgeon can then determine the amount or type of injury and, if necessary, take a biopsy speci- men or repair or correct the problem. Arthroscopic surgery can be used to remove floating bits of cartilage and treat minor tears and other disorders. When the pro- cedure is finished, the arthroscope is removed and the joint is irrigated. The site of the incision is bandaged. | No

8082 | NarrativeText | Considered the most important orthopedic develop- ment in the 20th century, arthroscopic surgery is widely used. The use of arthroscopic surgery on famous athletes has been well publicized. It is estimated that 80% of orthopedic surgeons practice arthroscopic surgery. Arthroscopic surgery was initially a diagnostic tool used prior to open surgery, but as better instruments and tech- niques were developed, it began to be used to actually treat a variety of joint problems. New techniques current- ly under development are likely to lead to other joints Immediately after the procedure, the patient will spend several hours in the recovery room. An ice pack will be put on the joint that was operated on for up to 48 hours after the procedure. Pain medicine, prescription or non-prescription, will be given. The morning after the surgery, the dressing can be removed and replaced by adhesive strips. The patient should call his/her doctor upon experiencing an increase in pain, swelling, redness, drainage or bleeding at the site of the surgery, signs of infection (headache, muscle aches, dizziness, fever), or nausea or vomiting. | No

8109 | NarrativeText | Arthroscopy is the examination of a joint, specifical- ly, the inside structures. The procedure is performed by inserting a specifically designed illuminated device into the joint through a small incision. This instrument is called an arthroscope. The procedure of arthroscopy is primarily associated with the process of diagnosis. How- ever, when actual repair is performed, the procedure is called arthroscopic surgery. | No
8110 | Title | Purpose | No
8111 | NarrativeText | Arthroscopy is used primarily by doctors who special- ize in treating disorders of the bones and related structures (orthopedics) to help diagnose joint problems. Once described as essential for those who primarily care for ath- letic injuries, arthroscopy is now a technique commonly used by orthopedic surgeons for the treatment of patients of all ages. This procedure is most commonly used to diagnose knee and shoulder problems, although the elbow, hip, wrist, and ankle may also be examined with an arthroscope. | No
8112 | NarrativeText | A joint is a complex system. Within a joint, ligaments attach bones to other bones, tendons attach muscles to bones, cartilage lines and helps protect the ends of bones, and a special fluid (synovial fluid) cushions and lubricates the structures. Looking inside the joint allows the doctors to see exactly which structures are damaged. Arthroscopy also permits earlier diagnosis of many types of joint prob- lems which had been difficult to detect in previous years. | No
8113 | Title | Precautions | No
8114 | NarrativeText | Most arthroscopic procedures today are performed in same-day surgery centers where the patient is admitted just before surgery. A few hours following the procedure, the patient is allowed to return home, although usually someone else must drive. Depending on the type of anes- thesia used, the patient may be told not to eat for several hours before arriving. Before the procedure, the anesthe- siologist will ask if the patient has any known allergies to local or general anesthetics.

8117 | Title | Description | No
8118 | NarrativeText | The arthroscope is an instrument used to look direct- ly into the joint. It contains magnifying lenses and glass- coated fibers that send concentrated light into the joint. A camera attached to the arthroscope allows the surgeon to see a clear image of the joint. This image is then trans- ferred to a monitor located in the operating room at the time of the arthroscopy. This video technology is also important for documentation of the arthroscopic proce- dure. For example, if the surgeon decides after the arthro- scopic examination that a conventional approach to sur- gically expose or “open” the joint (arthrotomy) must be used, a good photographic record will be useful when the surgeon returns to execute the final surgical plan. | No
8119 | NarrativeText | The procedure requires the surgeon to make several small incisions (portals) through the skin’s surface into the joint. Through one or two of the portals, a large-bore needle, called a cannula, is attached to tubing and inserted into the joint. The joint is inflated with a sterile saline solution to expand the joint and ensure clear arthroscopic viewing. Often, following a recent traumatic injury to a joint, the joint’s natural fluid may be cloudy, making inte- rior viewing of the joint difficult. In this condition, a con- stant flow of the saline solution is necessary. This inflow of saline solution may be through the cannula with the outflow through the arthroscope, or the positions may be reversed. The arthroscope is placed through one of the portals to view and evaluate the condition of the joint. | No

This is always an important preliminary step, because pain can often be referred to a joint from another area of the body. Anatomical models and pictures are use- ful aids to explain to the patient the proposed arthroscopy and what the surgeon may be looking at specifically. | No
8124 | NarrativeText | Proper draping of the body part is important to pre- vent contamination from instruments used in arthroscopy, such as the camera, light cords, and inflow and outflow drains placed in the portals. Draping packs used in arthroscopy include disposable paper gowns and drapes with adhesive backing. The surgeon may also place a tourniquet above the joint to temporarily block blood flow to the area during the arthroscopic exam. | No
8125 | NarrativeText | General or local anesthesia may be used during arthroscopy. Local anesthesia is usually used because it reduces the risk of lung and heart complications and allows the patient to go home sooner. The local anesthet- ic may be injected in small amounts in multiple locations in skin and joint tissues in a process called infiltration. In other cases, the anesthetic is injected into the spinal cord or a main nerve supplying the area. This process is called a “block,” and it blocks all sensation below the main trunk of the nerve. For example, a femoral block anes- thetizes the leg from the thigh down (its name comes from femur, the thighbone). Most patients are comfort- able once the skin, muscles, and other tissues around the joint are numbed by the anesthetic; however, some patients are also given a sedative if they express anxiety about the procedure. (It’s important for the patient to remain still during the arthroscopic examination.) | No
8126 | NarrativeText | General anesthesia, in which the patient becomes unconcious, may be used if the procedure may be unusu- ally complicated or painful. For example, people who have relatively “tight” joints may be candidates for gen- eral anesthesia because the procedure may take longer and cause more discomfort. | No
8127 | Title | Aftercare | No
8128 | NarrativeText | The portals are closed by small tape strips or stitches and covered with dressings and a bandage. The patient spends a short amount of time in the recovery room after arthroscopy. Most patients can go home after about an hour in the recovery room. Pain medication may be pre- scribed for a short period; however, many patients find various over-the-counter pain relievers sufficient. | No
8129 | NarrativeText | Following the surgical procedure, the patient needs to be aware of the signs of infection, which include red- ness, warmth, excessive pain, and swelling. The risk of infection increases if the incisions become wet too early | No

8132 | NarrativeText | The use of crutches is commonplace after arthro- scopy, with progression to independent walking on an “as tolerated” basis by the patient. Generally, a rehabilitation program, supervised by a physical therapist, follows short- ly after the arthroscopy to help the patient regain mobility and strength of the affected joint and limb. | No
8133 | Title | Risks | No
8134 | NarrativeText | The incidence of complications is low compared to the high number of arthroscopic procedures performed every year. Possible complications include infection, swelling, damage to the tissues in the joint, blood clots in the leg veins (thrombophlebitis), leakage of blood into the joint (hemarthrosis), blood clots that move to the lung (pulmonary embolus), and injury to the nerves around the joint. | No
8135 | Title | Normal results | No
8136 | NarrativeText | The goal of arthroscopy is to diagnose a joint prob- lem causing pain and/or restrictions in normal joint func- tion. For example, arthroscopy can be a useful tool in locating a tear in the joint surface of the knee or locating a torn ligament of the shoulder. Arthroscopic examina- tion is often followed by arthroscopic surgery performed to repair the problem with appropriate arthroscopic tools. The final result is to decrease pain, increase joint mobili- ty, and thereby improve the overall quality of the patient’s activities of daily living. | No
8137 | Title | Abnormal results | No
8138 | NarrativeText | Less optimal results that may require further treat- ment include adhesive capsulitis. In this condition, the joint capsule that naturally forms around the joint becomes thickened, forming adhesions. This results in a stiff and less mobile joint.

8166 | NarrativeText | In the late nineteenth century, French psychiatrists Ambrose Tardieu and Paul-Max Simon both published studies on the similar characteristics of and symbolism in the artwork of the mentally ill. Tardieu and Simon viewed art therapy as an effective diagnostic tool to iden- tify specific types of mental illness or traumatic events. Later, psychologists would use this diagnostic aspect to develop psychological drawing tests (the Draw-A-Man test, the Draw-A-Person Questionnaire [DAP.Q]) and projective personality tests involving visual symbol recognition (e.g., the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the The- matic Apperception Test [TAT], and the Holtzman Inkblot Test [HIT]). | No
8167 | NarrativeText | The growing popularity of milieu therapies at psy- chiatric institutions in the twentieth century was an important factor in the development of art therapy in the United States. Milieu therapies (or environmental thera- py) focus on putting the patient in a controlled therapeu- tic social setting that provides the patient with opportuni- ties to gain self-confidence and interact with peers in a positive way. Activities that encourage self-discovery and empowerment such as art, music, dance, and writing are important components of this approach. | No
8168 | NarrativeText | Educator and therapist Margaret Naumburg was a follower of both Freud and Jung, and incorporated art into psychotherapy as a means for her patients to visualize and recognize the unconscious. She founded the Walden School in 1915, where she used students’ artworks in psy- chological counseling. She published extensively on the subject and taught seminars on the technique at New York University in the 1950s. Today, she is considered the founder of art therapy in the United States. | No
8169 | NarrativeText | In the 1930s, Karl, William, and Charles Menninger introduced an art therapy program at their Kansas-based psychiatric hospital, the Menninger Clinic. The Men- ninger Clinic employed a number of artists in residence in the following years, and the facility was also consid- ered a leader in the art therapy movement through the 1950s and 60s. Other noted art therapy pioneers who emerged in the 50s and 60s include Edith Kramer, Hanna Yaxa Kwiatkowska (National Institute of Mental Health), and Janie Rhyne. | No
8170 | NarrativeText | Art therapy, sometimes called expressive art or art psychology, encourages self-discovery and emotional growth. It is a two part process, involving both the cre- ation of art and the discovery of its meaning. Rooted in Freud and Jung’s theories of the subconscious and unconscious, art therapy is based on the assumption that visual symbols and images are the most accessible and natural form of communication to the human experience. Patients are encouraged to visualize, and then create, the thoughts and emotions that they cannot talk about. The resulting artwork is then reviewed and its meaning inter- preted by the patient. | No
8171 | NarrativeText | The “analysis” of the artwork produced in art thera- py typically allows patients to gain some level of insight into their feelings and lets them to work through these issues in a constructive manner. Art therapy is typically practiced with individual, group, or family psychothera- py (talk therapy). While a therapist may provide critical guidance for these activities, a key feature of effective art therapy is that the patient/artist, not the therapist, directs the interpretation of the artwork. | No

8181 | NarrativeText | The supplies used in art therapy are limited only by the artist’s (and/or therapist’s) imagination. Some of the materials often used include paper, canvas, poster board, assorted paints, inks, markers, pencils, charcoals, chalks, fabrics, string, adhesives, clay, wood, glazes, wire, bend- able metals, and natural items (like shells, leaves, etc.). Providing artists with a variety of materials in assorted colors and textures can enhance their interest in the process and may result in a richer, more diverse explo- ration of their emotions in the resulting artwork. Appro- priate tools such as scissors, brushes, erasers, easels, sup- ply trays, glue guns, smocks or aprons, and cleaning materials are also essential. | No

8183 | NarrativeText | The artist should have adequate time to become comfortable with and explore the creative process. This is especially true for people who do not consider them- selves “artists” and may be uncomfortable with the con- cept.

8207 | NarrativeText | Asbestosis is a consequence of prolonged exposure to large quantities of asbestos, a material once widely used in construction, insulation, and manufacturing. When asbestos is inhaled, fibers penetrate the breathing passages and irritate, fill, inflame, and scar lung tissue. In advanced asbestosis,, the lungs shrink, stiffen, and become honeycombed (riddled with tiny holes). | No

Recurrent respiratory infections and coughing up blood are common. So is swelling of the feet, ankles, or hands. Other symptoms of advanced asbestosis include chest pain, hoarseness, and restless sleep. Patients who have asbestosis often have clubbed (widened and thick- ened) fingers.

8253 | Title | Description | No
8254 | NarrativeText | Rapidly developing (acute) ascites can occur as a complication of trauma, perforated ulcer, appendicitis, or inflammation of the colon or other tube-shaped organ (diverticulitis). This condition can also develop when intestinal fluids, bile, pancreatic juices, or bacteria invade or inflame the smooth, transparent membrane that lines the inside of the abdomen (peritoneum). However, ascites is more often associated with liver disease and other long-lasting (chronic) conditions. | No
8255 | Title | Types of ascites | No
8256 | NarrativeText | Cirrhosis, which is responsible for 80% of all instances of ascites in the United States, triggers a series of disease-producing changes that weaken the kidney’s ability to excrete sodium in the urine. | No
8257 | NarrativeText | Pancreatic ascites develops when a cyst that has thick, fibrous walls (pseudocyst) bursts and permits pan- creatic juices to enter the abdominal cavity. | No
8258 | NarrativeText | Chylous ascites has a milky appearance caused by lymph that has leaked into the abdominal cavity. Although chylous ascites is sometimes caused by trau- ma, abdominal surgery, tuberculosis, or another peri- toneal infection, it is usually a symptom of lymphoma or some other cancer. | No
8259 | NarrativeText | Cancer causes 10% of all instances of ascites in the United States. It is most commonly a consequence of dis- ease that originates in the peritoneum (peritoneal carci- nomatosis) or of cancer that spreads (metastasizes) from another part of the body. | No

8265 | Title | Causes | No
8266 | NarrativeText | The two most important factors in the production of ascites due to chronic liver disease are: + Low levels of albumin in the blood that cause a change in the pressure necessary to prevent fluid exchange (osmotic pressure). This change in pressure allows fluid to seep out of the blood vessels. | No
8267 | ListItem | ¢ An increase in the pressure within the branches of the portal vein that run through liver (portal hypertension). Portal hypertension is caused by the scarring that occurs in cirrhosis. Blood that cannot flow through the liver because of the increased pressure leaks into the abdomen and causes ascites. | No

8277 | NarrativeText | Physical examination generally enables doctors to distinguish ascites from pregnancy, intestinal gas, obe- sity, or ovarian tumors. Ultrasound or computed tomog- raphy scans (CT) can detect even small amounts of fluid. Laboratory analysis of fluid extracted by inserting a needle through the abdominal wall (diagnostic para- centesis) can help identify the cause of the accumulation. | No
8278 | Title | Treatment | No
8279 | NarrativeText | Reclining minimizes the amount of salt the kidneys absorb, so treatment generally starts with bed rest and a low-salt diet. Urine-producing drugs (diuretics) may be prescribed if initial treatment is ineffective. The weight and urinary output of patients using diuretics must be carefully monitored for signs of : * hypovolemia (massive loss of blood or fluid) | No

8281 | ListItem | * potassium imbalance + high sodium concentration. If the patient consumes more salt than the kidneys excrete, increased doses of diuretics should be prescribed | No
8282 | NarrativeText | Moderate-to-severe accumulations of fluid are treat- ed by draining large amounts of fluid (large-volume paracentesis) from the patient’s abdomen. This procedure is safer than diuretic therapy. It causes fewer complica- tions and requires a shorter hospital stay. | No

8293 | Title | Prognosis | No
8294 | NarrativeText | The prognosis depends upon the condition that is causing the ascites. Carcinomatous ascites has a very bad prognosis. However, salt restriction and diuretics can control ascites caused by liver disease in many cases. | No

8315 | Title | Purpose | No
8316 | NarrativeText | The determination of AST levels aids primarily in the diagnosis of liver disease. In the past, the AST test was used to diagnose heart attack (myocardial infarc- tion or MI) but more accurate blood tests have largely replaced it for cardiac purposes. | No
8317 | Title | Description | No
8318 | NarrativeText | AST is determined by analysis of a blood sample, usually from taken from a venipuncture site at the bend of the elbow. | No
8319 | Title | test | No
8320 | NarrativeText | AST is found in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, lung, red blood cells, and brain tissue. When disease or injury affects these tissues, the cells are destroyed and AST is released into the blood- stream. The amount of AST is directly related to the number of cells affected by the disease or injury, but the level of elevation depends on the length of time that the blood is tested after the injury. Serum AST levels become elevated eight hours after cell injury, peak at 24- 36 hours, and return to normal in three to seven days. If the cellular injury is chronic (ongoing), AST levels will remain elevated. | No
8321 | NarrativeText | One of the most important uses for AST determina- tion has formerly been in the diagnosis of a heart attack, or MI. AST can assist in determining the timing and extent of a recent MI, although it is less specific than cre- atine phosphokinase (CPK), CKMB, myglobin, tro- ponins, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Assuming no further cardiac injury occurs, the AST level rises within 6-10 hours after an acute attack, peaks at 12-48 hours, and returns to normal in three to four days. Myocardial injuries such as angina (chest pain) or pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium, the membrane around the heart) do not increase AST levels. | No
8322 | NarrativeText | AST is also a valuable aid in the diagnosis of liver disease. Although not specific for liver disease, it can be used in combination with other enzymes to monitor the course of various liver disorders. Chronic, silent hepatitis (hepatitis C) is sometimes the cause of elevat- ed AST. In alcoholic hepatitis, caused by excessive alcohol ingestion, AST values are usually moderately elevated; in acute viral hepatitis, AST levels can rise to over 20 times normal. Acute extrahepatic (outside the liver) obstruction (e.g. gallstone), produces AST levels that can quickly rise to 10 times normal, and then rapid- ly fall. In cases of cirrhosis, the AST level is related to the amount of active inflammation of the liver. Determi- nation of AST also assists in early recognition of toxic hepatitis that results from exposure to drugs toxic to the liver, like acetaminophen and cholesterol lowering medications. | No
8323 | NarrativeText | Other disorders or diseases in which the AST deter- mination can be valuable include acute pancreatitis, muscle disease, trauma, severe burn, and infectious mononucleosis. | No

In alcoholics, even moderate doses of the analgesic aceta- minophen have caused extreme elevations (1,960-29,700 units/L). Moderate rises of AST are seen in jaundice, cirrhosis, and metastatic carcinoma. Approximately 80% of patients with infectious mononucleosis show eleva- tions in the range of 100-600 units/L. | No

8342 | Title | Definition | No
8343 | NarrativeText | Aspergillosis refers to several forms of disease caused by a fungus in the genus Aspergillus. Aspergillo- sis fungal infections can occur in the ear canal, eyes, nose, sinus cavities, and lungs. In some individuals, the infection can even invade bone and the membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). | No
8344 | Title | Description | No
8345 | NarrativeText | Aspergillosis is primarily an infection of the lungs caused by the inhalation of airborne spores of the fungus Aspergillus. Spores are the small particles that most fungi use to reproduce. Although virtually everyone is exposed to this fungus in their daily environment, it rarely causes disease. When Aspergillus does cause dis- ease, however, it usually occurs in those individuals with weakened immune systems (immunocompromised) or who have a history of respiratory ailments. Because it does not present distinctive symptoms, aspergillosis is generally thought to be underdiagnosed and underre- ported. Furthermore, many patients with the more severe forms of aspergillosis tend to have multiple, complex health problems, such as AIDS or a blood disorder like leukemia, which can further complicate diagnosis and treatment. | No
8346 | NarrativeText | Once considered particularly rare, the incidence of reported aspergillosis has risen somewhat with the devel- opment of more sophisticated methods of diagnosis and advances made in other areas of medicine, such as with the increased use of certain chemotherapeutic and corti- costeroid drugs that are extremely useful in treating vari- ous types of cancer but that decrease the individual’s immune response, making them more susceptible to other diseases like aspergillosis. | No
8347 | NarrativeText | Our advanced ability to perform tissue and organ transplants has also increased the number of people vul- nerable to fungal infections. Transplant recipients, partic- ularly those receiving bone marrow or heart transplants, are highly susceptible to Aspergillus, which may be cir- culating in the hospital air. | No
8348 | NarrativeText | Aspergillosis can be a serious, potentially deadly threat for two primary reasons: + Aspergillosis usually occurs in those individuals who are already ill or have weakened immune systems, such as patients who have undergone chemotherapy for cancer. | No
8349 | ListItem | ¢ None of the currently available antifungal drugs are reliably effective against Aspergillus. | No
8350 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
8351 | NarrativeText | Aspergillus is a fungus that is found almost everywhere, but particularly in soil, water, decaying vegetation, and stored grain. The fungus has also been cultured from ventila- tion systems and may be stirred up during building renova- tions. The species most commonly identified in patients with confirmed disease are A. fumigatus and A. flavus. | No
8352 | NarrativeText | Airborne Aspergillus spores enter the body primarily through inhalation but can also lodge in the ear or eye. Normally functioning immune systems are generally able to cope without consequent development of aspergillosis. | No
8353 | NarrativeText | It is important to make distinctions between the vari- ous forms of aspergillosis, as the treatment and prognosis varies considerably among types. Aspergillosis as a diag- nosis refers to three general forms: + Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is seen in patients with long-standing asthma, particular- ly in patients taking oral corticosteroids for a long period of time. This is usually the least serious and most treatable form. | No
8354 | ListItem | « Aspergilloma refers to the mass formed when fungal spores settle into or colonize areas of the lung that have been pitted and scarred as a result of tuberculosis or prior pneumonia. There are several available treatments, although the success rate varies with each treatment. | No
8355 | ListItem | + Invasive fungal infection refers to rare cases in which the fungus spreads throughout the body via the blood stream and invades other organ systems. Once estab- lished, invasive fungal infections are extremely difficult to cure and, as a result, the associated death rate is extremely high. | No
8356 | NarrativeText | Aspergillus infection of the ear (called otomycosis), can produce itching and a discharge, sometimes noticed as a spot on the pillow. Fungal infection of the cornea of the eye in a susceptible person can result in blindness, if not diagnosed and treated promptly. | No
8357 | Title | Diagnosis | No
8358 | NarrativeText | Aspergillosis can be quite difficult to diagnose because the symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing, if present at all, are common to many respiratory disor- ders. Furthermore, blood and sputum cultures are not very helpful. The presence of Aspergillus is so common, even in asthmatics, that a positive culture alone is insuffi- cient for a diagnosis. Other, potentially more useful, screening tools include examining the sample obtained after repeatedly washing the bronchial tubes of the lung with water (bronchial lavage), but examining a tissue sample (biopsy) is the most reliable diagnostic tool. Researchers are currently attempting to develop a practi- : Aspergillus Aspergillosis is an infection of the lungs caused by inhala- tion of airborne spores of the fungus Aspergillus.

8360 | NarrativeText | Signs of ABPA include a worsening of bronchial asthma accompanied by a low-grade fever. Brown flecks or clumps may be seen in the sputum. Pulmonary func- tion tests may show decreased blood flow, suggesting an obstruction within the lungs. Elevated blood levels of an antibody produced in response to Aspergillus and of cer- tain immune system cells may indicate a specific aller- gic-type immune system response. | No
8361 | NarrativeText | A fungal mass (aspergilloma) in the lung usually does not produce clear symptoms and is generally diag- nosed when seen on chest x rays. However, 70% or more of patients spit up blood from the lungs (hemoptysis) at least once, and this may become repetitive and serious. Hemoptysis, then, is another indication that the patient may be suffering from an aspergilloma. | No
8362 | NarrativeText | In patients with lowered immune systems who are at risk for developing invasive aspergillosis, the physician may use a combination of blood culture with visual diag- nostic techniques, such as computed tomography scans (CT) and radiography, to arrive at a likely diagnosis. | No
8363 | Title | Treatment | No
8364 | NarrativeText | The treatment method selected depends on the form of aspergillosis. ABPA can usually be treated with many | No
8365 | Title | 376 | No
8366 | NarrativeText | of the same drugs used to treat asthma, such as systemic steroids. Long-term therapy may be required, however, to prevent recurrence. Antifungal agents are not recom- mended in the treatment of ABPA. In cases of aspergillo- ma, it may become necessary to surgically remove or reduce the size of a fungal mass, especially if the patient continues to spit up blood. In aspergillosis cases affecting the nose and nasal sinuses, surgery may also be required. | No
8367 | NarrativeText | In non-ABPA cases, the use of antifungal drugs may be indicated. In such cases, amphotericin B (Fungizone) is the first-line therapy. The prescribed dose will depend on the patient’s condition but usually begins with a small test dose and then escalates. Less than one-third of patients are likely to respond to amphotericin B, and its side effects often limit its use. For patients who do not respond to oral amphotericin B, another option is a dif- ferent formulation of the same drug called liposomal amphotericin B. | No
8368 | NarrativeText | For patients who fail to respond or who cannot toler- ate amphotericin B, another drug called itraconazole (Sporanox), given 400-600 mg daily, has also been approved. Treatment generally lasts about 3 months. Giv- ing itraconazole can produce adverse reactions if pre- scribed in combination with certain other drugs by increasing the concentrations of both drugs in the blood and creating a potentially life-threatening situation. Even antacids can significantly affect itraconazole levels. As a result, drug levels must be continually monitored to ensure that absorption is occurring at acceptable levels. | No
8369 | NarrativeText | Two other methods of treatment are being studied: direct instillation of an antifungal agent into the lungs and administration of antifungals using a nebulizer. Instilling or injecting amphotericin B or itraconazole directly into the lung cavity or into the fungal ball (aspergilloma) itself has been helpful in stopping episodes of hemoptysis, but not in preventing future recurrences. Furthermore, many patients with aspergillo- mas are poor risks for surgery because their lung func- tion is already compromised. As a result, instillation of a fungal agent should only be considered in those who have significant hempotysis. | No
8370 | NarrativeText | A popular method of treating some respiratory dis- orders is to add a liquid drug to another carrier liquid and aerosolize or produce a fine mist that can be inhaled into the lungs through a device called a nebulizer. However, this has not yet been shown to improve the patient’s con- dition in cases of aspergillosis, possibly because the drug is not reaching the aspergilloma. | No
8371 | NarrativeText | At this point, preventative therapy for aspergillosis is not suggested for susceptible individuals, primarily because overuse of the drugs used to fight fungal infec- tions may lead to the development of drug-resistant aspergillosis against which current antifungal drugs are no longer effective. | No
8372 | Title | Prognosis | No
8373 | NarrativeText | The likelihood of recovery from aspergillosis depends on any underlying medical conditions, the patient’s gener- al health, and the specific type of aspergillosis. If the prob- lem is based on an allergic response, as in ABPA, the patient will likely respond well to systemic steroids. | No
8374 | NarrativeText | Patients who require lung surgery, especially those who have problems with coughing up blood, have a mortal- ity rate of about 7-14%, and complications or recurrence may result in a higher overall death rate. However, by treat- ing aspergilloma with other, non-surgical methods, that risk rises to 26%, making surgery a better option in some cases. | No
8375 | NarrativeText | Unfortunately, the prognosis for the most serious form, invasive aspergillosis, is quite poor, largely because these patients have little resilience due to their underlying disorders. Death rates have ranged from about 50% in some studies to as high as 95% for bone-marrow recipients and patients with AIDS. The course of the illness can be rapid, resulting in death within a few months of diagnosis. | No
8376 | Title | Prevention | No
8377 | NarrativeText | Fungal infection by Aspergillus presents a major challenge, particularly in the patient with a suppressed immune system (immunocompromised). Hospitals and government health agencies continually seek ways to minimize exposure for hospitalized patients. Practical suggestions are minimal but include moving leaf piles away from the house. Unfortunately, overall avoidance of this fungus is all but impossible because it is present in the environment virtually everywhere. Research efforts are being directed at enhancing patients’ resistance to Aspergillus rather than trying to eliminate exposure to the fungus. Given the growing number of people with immune disorders or whose immune systems have been suppressed in the course of treating another disease, research and clinical trials for new antifungal agents will be increasingly important in the future. | No

8401 | NarrativeText | Aspirin is a medicine that relieves pain and reduces fever. | No
8402 | Title | Purpose | No
8403 | NarrativeText | Aspirin is used to relieve many kinds of minor aches and pains—headaches, toothaches, muscle pain, men- strual cramps, the joint pain from arthritis, and aches associated with colds and flu. Some people take aspirin daily to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other heart problems. | No
8404 | Title | Description | No
8405 | NarrativeText | Aspirin—also known as acetylsalicylic acid—is sold over the counter and comes in many forms, from the familiar white tablets to chewing gum and rectal supposi- tories. Coated, chewable, buffered, and extended release forms are available. Many other over-the-counter medi- cine contain aspirin. Alka-Seltzer Original Effervescent Antacid Pain Reliever, for example, contains aspirin for pain relief and sodium bicarbonate to relieve acid indi- gestion, heartburn, and sour stomach. | No
8406 | NarrativeText | Aspirin belongs to a group of drugs called salicy- lates. Other members of this group include sodium salicy- late, choline salicylate, and magnesium salicylate. These drugs are more expensive and no more effective than aspirin. However, they are a little easier on the stomach. Aspirin is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and pro- vides quick and relatively long-lasting pain relief. Aspirin also reduces inflammation. Researchers believe these effects come about because aspirin blocks the production of pain-producing chemicals called prostaglandins. | No
8407 | NarrativeText | In addition to relieving pain and reducing inflamma- tion, aspirin also lowers fever by acting on the part of the brain that regulates temperature. The brain then signals the blood vessels to widen, which allows heat to leave the body more quickly. | No

8447 | NarrativeText | The most common side effects include stomachache, heartburn, loss of appetite, and small amounts of blood in stools. Less common side effects are rashes, hives, fever, vision problems, liver damage, thirst, stomach ulcers, and bleeding. People who are allergic to aspirin or those who have asthma, rhinitis, or polyps in the nose may have trouble breathing after taking aspirin. | No
8448 | Title | nteractions | No
8449 | NarrativeText | Aspirin may increase, decrease, or change the effects of many drugs. Aspirin can make drugs such as methotrexate (Rheumatrex) and valproic acid (Depakote, Depakene) more toxic. If taken with blood-thinning drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and dicumarol, aspirin can increase the risk of excessive bleeding. Aspirin counteracts the effects of other drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers, which lower blood pressure, and medi- cines used to treat gout (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone). Blood pressure may drop unexpectedly and cause faint- ing or dizziness if aspirin is taken along with nitroglyc- erin tablets. Aspirin may also interact with diuretics, dia- betes medicines, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), seizure medications, and steroids. Anyone who is taking these drugs should ask his or her physician whether they can safely take aspirin. | No

8460 | NarrativeText | Today asthma is viewed as a chronic (long-lasting) inflammatory disease of the airways. In those susceptible to asthma, this inflammation causes the airways to nar- row periodically. This, in turn, produces wheezing and breathlessness, sometimes to the point where the patient gasps for air. Obstruction to air flow either stops sponta- neously or responds to a wide range of treatments, but continuing inflammation makes the airways hyper- responsive to stimuli such as cold air, exercise, dust mites, pollutants in the air, and even stress and anxiety. | No
8461 | Title | Description | No
8462 | NarrativeText | About 10 million Americans have asthma, and the number seems to be increasing. Between 1982-92, the rate actually rose by 42%. Not only is asthma becoming more frequent, but it also is a more severe disease than before, despite modern drug treatments. In the same 10- year period, the death rate from asthma in the United States increased by 35%. | No
8463 | NarrativeText | The changes that take place in the lungs of asth- matic persons makes the airways (the “breathing tubes,” or bronchi and the smaller bronchioles) hyper-reactive to many different types of stimuli that don’t affect healthy lungs. In an asthma attack, the muscle tissue in the walls of bronchi go into spasm, and the cells lining the airways swell and secrete mucus into the air spaces. Both these actions cause the bronchi to become nar- rowed (bronchoconstriction). As a result, an asthmatic person has to make a much greater effort to breathe in air and to expel it. | No
8464 | NarrativeText | Cells in the bronchial walls, called mast cells, release certain substances that cause the bronchial mus- cle to contract and stimulate mucus formation. These substances, which include histamine and a group of chemicals called leukotrienes, also bring white blood cells into the area, which is a key part of the inflammato- ry response. Many patients with asthma are prone to react to such “foreign” substances as pollen, house dust mites, or animal dander; these are called allergens. On the other hand, asthma affects many patients who are not “allergic” in this way. | No
8465 | NarrativeText | Asthma usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but it also may first appear during adult years. While the symptoms may be similar, certain important aspects of asthma are different in children and adults. | No
8466 | Title | Child-onset asthma | No
8467 | NarrativeText | When asthma does begin in childhood, it often does so ina child who is likely, for genetic reasons, to become sensitized to common “allergens” in the environment (atopic person). When these children are exposed to house-dust mites, animal proteins, fungi, or other poten- tial allergens, they produce a type of antibody that is intended to engulf and destroy the foreign materials. This has the effect of making the airway cells sensitive to par- ticular materials. Further exposure can lead rapidly to an | No

8469 | NarrativeText | asthmatic response. This condition of atopy is present in at least one-third and as many as half of the general pop- ulation. When an infant or young child wheezes during viral infections, the presence of allergy (in the child itself or a close relative) is a clue that asthma may well contin- ue throughout childhood. | No
8470 | Title | Adult-onset asthma | No
8471 | NarrativeText | Allergenic materials may also play a role when adults become asthmatic. Asthma can actually start at any age and in a wide variety of situations. Many adults who are not allergic do have such conditions as sinusitis or nasal polyps, or they may be sensitive to aspirin and related drugs. Another major source of adult asthma is exposure at work to animal products, certain forms of plastic, wood dust, or metals. | No
8472 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
8473 | NarrativeText | In most cases, asthma is caused by inhaling an aller- gen that sets off the chain of biochemical and tissue changes leading to airway inflammation, bronchocon- striction, and wheezing. Because avoiding (or at least minimizing) exposure is the most effective way of treat- ing asthma, it is vital to identify which allergen or irritant is causing symptoms in a particular patient. Once asthma is present, symptoms can be set off or made worse if the patient also has rhinitis (inflammation of the lining of the nose) or sinusitis. When, for some reason, stomach acid passes back up the esophagus (acid reflux), this can also make asthma worse. A viral infection of the respira- tory tract can also inflame an asthmatic reaction. Aspirin and a type of drug called beta-blockers, often used to treat high blood pressure, can also worsen the symptoms of asthma. | No
8474 | NarrativeText | The most important inhaled allergens giving rise to attacks of asthma are: * animal dander * mites in house dust | No
8475 | ListItem | ¢ fungi (molds) that grow indoors * cockroach allergens | No
8476 | ListItem | * pollen * occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or particles of industrial materials in the air | No
8477 | ListItem | * inhaling cold air (cold-induced asthma) | No
8478 | ListItem | * exercise-induced asthma (in certain children, asthma is caused simply by exercising) | No
8479 | ListItem | * stress or a high level of anxiety Wheezing is often very obvious, but mild asthmatic attacks may be confirmed when the physician listens to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope. Besides wheezing and being short of breath, the patient may cough and may report a feeling of “tightness” in the chest. Children may have itching on their back or neck at the start of an attack. Wheezing is often loudest when the patient breathes out, in an attempt to expel used air through the narrowed airways. Some asthmatics are free of symp- toms most of the time but may occasionally be short of breath for a brief time. Others spend much of their days (and nights) coughing and wheezing, until properly treat- ed. Crying or even laughing may bring on an attack. Severe episodes are often seen when the patient gets a viral respiratory tract infection or is exposed to a heavy load of an allergen or irritant. Asthmatic attacks may last only a few minutes or can go on for hours or even days (a condition called status asthmaticus). | No
8480 | NarrativeText | Being short of breath may cause a patient to become very anxious, sit upright, lean forward, and use the mus- cles of the neck and chest wall to help breathe. The patient may be able to say only a few words at a time before stopping to take a breath. Confusion and a bluish tint to the skin are clues that the oxygen supply is much too low, and that emergency treatment is needed. In a severe attack that lasts for some time, some of the air sacs in the lung may rupture so that air collects within the chest. This makes it even harder to breathe in enough air. Almost always, even patients with the most severe attacks will recover completely. | No
8481 | Title | Diagnosis | No
8482 | NarrativeText | Apart from listening to the patient’s chest, the exam- iner should look for maximum chest expansion while taking in air. Hunched shoulders and contracting neck muscles are other signs of narrowed airways. Nasal polyps or increased amounts of nasal secretions are often noted in asthmatic patients. Skin changes, like atopic dermatitis or eczema, are a tipoff that the patient has allergic problems. | No
8483 | NarrativeText | Inquiring about a family history of asthma or aller- gies can be a valuable indicator of asthma. The diagnosis may be strongly suggested when typical symptoms and signs are present. A test called spirometry measures how rapidly air is exhaled and how much is retained in the lungs. Repeating the test after the patient inhales a drug that widens the air passages (a bronchodilator) will show whether the airway narrowing is reversible, which is a very typical finding in asthma. Often patients use a relat- ed instrument, called a peak flow meter, to keep track of asthma severity when at home. | No
8484 | NarrativeText | Often, it is difficult to determine what is triggering asthma attacks. Allergy skin testing may be used, although an allergic skin response does not always mean that the allergen being tested is causing the asthma. Also, the body’s immune system produces antibody to fight off the allergen, and the amount of antibody can be mea- sured by a blood test. This will show how sensitive the patient is to a particular allergen. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, the patient can inhale a suspect allergen while using a spirometer to detect airway narrowing. Spirome- try can also be repeated after a bout of exercise if exer- cise-induced asthma is a possibility. A chest x ray will help rule out other disorders. | No
8485 | Title | Treatment | No
8486 | NarrativeText | Patients should be periodically examined and have their lung function measured by spirometry to make sure that treatment goals are being met. These goals are to pre- vent troublesome symptoms, to maintain lung function as close to normal as possible, and to allow patients to pur- sue their normal activities including those requiring exer- tion. The best drug therapy is that which controls asthmat- ic symptoms while causing few or no side-effects. | No
8487 | Title | Drugs | No
8488 | NarrativeText | METHYLXANTHINES. The chief methylxanthine drug is theophylline. It may exert some anti-inflammatory effect, and is especially helpful in controlling nighttime symptoms of asthma. When, for some reason, a patient cannot use an inhaler to maintain long-term control, sus- tained-release theophylline is a good alternative. The blood levels of the drug must be measured periodically, as too high a dose can cause an abnormal heart rhythm or convulsions. | No
8489 | NarrativeText | BETA-RECEPTOR AGONISTS. These drugs, which are bronchodilators, are the best choice for relieving sudden attacks of asthma and for preventing attacks from being triggered by exercise. Some agonists, such as albuterol, act mainly in lung cells and have little effect on other organs, such as the heart. These drugs generally start act- ing within minutes, but their effects last only four to six hours (although longer-acting forms are being devel- oped). They may be taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected. | No
8490 | NarrativeText | STEROIDS. These drugs, which resemble natural body hormones, block inflammation and are extremely effective in relieving symptoms of asthma. When steroids are taken by inhalation for a long period, asthma In normal bronchioles the airway is open and unobstructed. During an attack, the bronchioles of an asthma sufferer are constricted by bands of muscle around them. They may be further obstructed by increased mucus production and tissue inflammation. | No

8492 | NarrativeText | attacks become less frequent as the airways become less sensitive to allergens. This is the strongest medicine for asthma, and can control even severe cases over the long term and maintain good lung function. Steroids can cause numerous side-effects, however, including bleed- ing from the stomach, loss of calcium from bones, cataracts in the eye, and a diabetes-like state. Patients using steroids for lengthy periods may also have prob- lems with wound healing, may gain weight, and may suf- fer mental problems. In children, growth may be slowed.

8494 | NarrativeText | OTHER DRUGS. Cromolyn and nedocromil are anti- inflammatory drugs that are often used as initial treatment to prevent asthmatic attacks over the long term in children. They can also prevent attacks when given before exercise or when exposure to an allergen cannot be avoided. These are safe drugs but are expensive, and must be taken regular- ly even if there are no symptoms. Anti-cholinergic drugs, such as atropine, are useful in controlling severe attacks when added to an inhaled beta-receptor agonist. They help widen the airways and suppress mucus production. | No

Leukotriene modifiers are a new type of drug that can be used in place of steroids, for older children or adults who have a mild degree of asthma that persists. They work by counteract- If a patient’s asthma is caused by an allergen that cannot be avoided and it has been difficult to control symptoms by drugs, immunotherapy may be worth try- ing. Typically, increasing amounts of the allergen are injected over a period of three to five years, so that the body can build up an effective immune response. There is a risk that this treatment may itself cause the airways to become narrowed and bring on an asthmatic attack. Not all experts are enthusiastic about immunotherapy, although some studies have shown that it does reduce asthmatic symptoms caused by exposure to house-dust mites, ragweed pollen, and cats. | No
8496 | Title | Managing asthmatic attacks | No
8497 | NarrativeText | A severe asthma attack should be treated as quickly as possible. It is most important for a patient suffering an acute attack to be given extra oxygen. Rarely, it may be necessary to use a mechanical ventilator to help the patient breathe. A beta-receptor agonist is inhaled repeat- edly or continuously. If the patient does not respond promptly and completely, a steroid is given. A course of steroid therapy, given after the attack is over, will make a recurrence less likely. | No
8498 | Title | Maintaining control | No
8499 | NarrativeText | Long-term asthma treatment is based on inhaling a beta-receptor agonist using a special inhaler that meters the dose. Patients must be instructed in proper use of an inhaler to be sure that it will deliver the right amount of drug. Once asthma has been controlled for several weeks or months, it is worth trying to cut down on drug treatment, but this must be done gradually. The last drug added should be the first to be reduced. Patients should be seen every one to six months, depending on the frequency of attacks. | No
8500 | NarrativeText | Starting treatment at home, rather than in hospital, makes for minimal delay and helps the patient to gain a sense of control over the disease. All patients should be taught how to monitor their symptoms so that they will know when an attack is starting, and those with moderate or severe asthma should know how to use a flow meter. They should also have a written “action plan” to follow if symptoms suddenly become worse, including how to adjust their medication and when to seek medical help. If more intense treatment is necessary, it should be contin- ued for several days. Over-the-counter “remedies” should be avoided. When deciding whether a patient should be hospitalized, the past history of acute attacks, severity of symptoms, current medication, and whether good support is available at home all must be taken into account. | No

8505 | NarrativeText | INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. It is especially important to closely watch the course of asthma in young patients. Treatment is cut down when possible and if there is no clear improvement, some other treatment should be tried. If a viral infection leads to severe asth- matic symptoms, steroids may help. The health care provider should write out an asthma treatment plan for the child’s school. Asthmatic children often need med- ication at school to control acute symptoms or to prevent exercise- induced attacks. Proper management will usu- ally allow a child to take part in play activities. Only as a last resort should activities be limited. | No
8506 | NarrativeText | THE ELDERLY. Older persons often have other types of obstructive lung disease, such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema. This makes it important to know to what extent the symptoms are caused by asthma. Giving steroids for two to three weeks can help determine this. Side-effects from beta-receptor agonist drugs (including a speeding heart and tremor) may be more common in older patients. These patients may benefit from receiving an anti-choliner- gic drug, along with the beta-receptor agonist. If theo- phylline is given, the dose should be limited, as older patients are less able to clear this drug from their blood. Steroids should be avoided, as they often make elderly patients confused and agitated. Steroids may also further weaken the bones. | No
8507 | Title | Prognosis | No
8508 | NarrativeText | Most patients with asthma respond well when the best drug or combination of drugs is found, and they are able to lead relatively normal lives. More than half of affected children stop having attacks by the time they reach 21 years of age. Many others have less frequent and less severe attacks as they grow older. Urgent mea- sures to control asthma attacks and ongoing treatment to prevent attacks are equally important. A small minority of patients will have progressively more trouble breath- ing and they run a risk of going into respiratory failure and they must receive intensive treatment. | No

8535 | NarrativeText | Astigmatism is the result of an inability of the cornea to properly focus an image onto the retina. The result is a blurred image. | No
8536 | Title | Description | No
8537 | NarrativeText | The cornea is the outermost part of the eye. It is a transparent layer that covers the colored part of the eye (iris), pupil, and lens. The cornea bends light and helps to focus it onto the retina where specialized cells (photo receptors) detect light and transmit nerve impulses via the optic nerve to the brain where the image is formed. The cornea is dome shaped. Any incorrect shaping of the cornea results in an incorrect focusing of the light that passes through that part of the cornea. The bending of light is called refraction and focusing problems with the cornea are called diseases of refraction or refractive dis- orders. Astigmatism is an image distortion that results from an improperly shaped cornea. Usually the cornea is spherically shaped, like a baseball. However, in astigma- tism the cornea is elliptically shaped, more like a foot- ball. There is a long meridian and a short meridian. These two meridians generally have a constant curvature and are generally perpendicular to each other (regular astigmatism). Irregular astigmatism may have more than two meridians of focus and they may not be 90° apart. A point of light, therefore, going through an astigmatic cornea will have two points of focus, instead of one nice sharp image on the retina. This will cause the person to have blurry vision. What the blur looks like will depend upon the amount and the direction of the astigmatism. A person with nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) may see a dot as a blurred circle. A person with astigmatism may see the same dot as a blurred oval or frankfurter-shaped blur. | No
8538 | NarrativeText | Some cases of astigmatism are caused by problems in the lens of the eye. Minor variations in the curvature of the lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatism (lenticular astigmatism). In these patients, the cornea is usually normal in shape. Infants, as a group, have the least amount of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase during childhood, as the eye is developing. | No
8539 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
8540 | NarrativeText | The main symptom of astigmatism is blurring. Peo- ple can also experience headaches and eyestrain. Parents can notice that a child may have astigmatism when the child can see some part of a pattern or picture more clear- ly than others. For example, lines going across may seem clearer than lines going up and down. | No
8541 | NarrativeText | Regular astigmatism can be caused by the weight of the upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating distortion, surgical incisions in the cornea, trauma or scarring to the cornea, the presence of tumors in the eyelid, or a develop- mental factor. Irregular astigmatism can be caused by scar- ring or keratoconus. Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea thins and becomes cone shaped. It usually occurs around puberty and is more common in women. Although the causes of keratoconus are unknown, it may be hereditary or a result of chronic eye rubbing, as in peo- ple with allergies. The center of the cone may not be in line with the center of the cornea. Diabetes can play a role in the development of astigmatism. High blood sugar lev- els can cause shape changes in the lens of the eye. This process usually occurs slowly and, often, is only noticed when the diabetic has started treatment to control their blood sugar. The return to a more normal blood sugar allows the lens to return to normal and this change is sometimes noticed by the patient as farsightedness. Because of this, diabetics should wait until their blood sugar is under control for at least one month to allow vision to stabilize before being measured for eyeglasses. | No
8542 | Title | Diagnosis | No
8543 | NarrativeText | Patients seek treatment because of blurred vision. A variety of tests can be used to detect astigmatism during the eye exam. The patient may be asked to describe the astigmatic dial, a series of lines that radiate outward from a center. People with astigmatism will see some of the lines more clearly than others. One diagnostic instrument used is the keratometer. This measures the curvature of the central cornea. It measures the amount and direction of the curvature. A corneal topographer can measure a Retina Cornea Horizontal line out of focus Light Astigmatism corrected by lens | No
8544 | NarrativeText | Astigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses. The lenses are shaped to counteract the shape of the sec- tions of the cornea that are causing the difficulty. (//lustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.) | No
8545 | NarrativeText | larger area of the cornea. It can measure the central area and mid-periphery of the cornea. A keratoscope projects a series of concentric light rings onto the cornea. Mis- shapen areas of the cornea are revealed by noting areas of the light pattern that do not appear concentric on the cornea. Because these instruments are measuring the comea, it is also important to have a refraction in case the lens is also contributing to the astigmatism. The refrac- tion measures the optics or visual status of the eye and the result is the eyeglass prescription. The refraction is when the patient is looking at an eye chart and the doctor is putting different lenses in front of the patient’s eyes and asks which one looks better. | No
8546 | Title | Treatment | No
8547 | NarrativeText | Astigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses. They can be in eyeglasses or contact lenses. The unit of measure describing the power of the lens system or lens is called the diopter (D). The lenses are shaped to counteract the shape of the sections of cornea that are caus- ing the difficulty. Because the correction is in one direction, it is written in terms of the axis the correction is in. On a prescription, for example, it may say -1.00D x 180°. | No

8553 | NarrativeText | There is some debate as to whether people with very small amounts of astigmatism should be treated. Gener- ally, if visual acuity is good and the patient experiences no overt symptoms, treatment is not necessary. When treating larger amounts of astigmatism, or astigmatism for the first time, the doctor may not totally correct the astigmatism. The cylindrical correction in the eyeglasses may make the floor appear to tilt, thus making it difficult for the patient at first. Generally, the doctor will place lenses in a trial frame to allow the patient to try the pre- scription at the exam. It may take a week or so to get used to the glasses, however, if the patient is having a problem they should contact their doctor, who might want to recheck the prescription. | No
8554 | NarrativeText | Contact lenses that are used to correct astigmatism are called toric lenses. When a person blinks, the contact lens rotates. In toric lenses, it is important for the lens to return to the same position each time. Lenses have thin zones, or cut-off areas (truncated), or have other ways to rotate and return to the correct position. Soft toric lenses are available in a variety of prescriptions, materials, and even in tints. Patients should ask their doctors about the possibility of toric lenses. | No
8555 | NarrativeText | In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved laser treatment of astigmatism. Patients consid- ering this should make sure the surgeon has a lot of expe- rience in the procedure and discuss the possible side effects or risks with the doctor.

8576 | NarrativeText | Judith Aston was born in Long Beach, California. She graduated from University of California at Los Ange- les with a B.A. and a M.F.A. in dance. Her interest in movement arose from working as a dancer. In 1963 Aston established her first movement education pro- gram for dancers, actors, and athletes at Long Beach City College. | No
8577 | NarrativeText | Five years later, while recovering from injuries sus- tained during two consecutive automobile accidents, Aston met Ida Rolf, the developer of Rolfing. Aston began working for Rolf, teaching a movement education program called Rolf-Aston Structural Patterning that emphasized using the body with minimum effort and maximum precision. | No
8578 | NarrativeText | In time, Rolf and Aston’s views on movement diverged, and the partnership was dissolved in 1977. Aston formed her own company called the Aston Para- digm Corporation in Lake Tahoe, California. This com- pany provides training and certification for Aston practi- tioners. She also began exploring how environmental conditions affect body movement, foreshadowing the ergonomic movement in the workplace that developed in the 1990s. Over time, Aston has expanded her move- ment work to include a fitness program for older adults. Today, Judith Aston serves as director of Aston Paradigm Corporation. | No

The massage aspect of Aston-Patterning is designed around a three- dimensional, non-compressive touch that releases pat- terns of tension in the body. It is gentler than Rolfing. Myokinetics uses touch to release tension in the face and neck. Arthrokinetics addresses tension at bones and joints. This massage is accompanied by education about how new movement patterns may be established. | No

8599 | NarrativeText | Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), also called Louis-Bar syndrome, is a rare, genetic neurological disorder of child- hood that progressively destroys part of the motor control area of the brain, leading to a lack of balance and coordina- tion. A-T also affects the immune system and increases the risk of leukemia and lymphoma in affected individuals. | No
8600 | Title | Description | No
8601 | NarrativeText | The disorder first appeared in the medical literature in the mid-1920s, but was not named specifically until 1957. The name is a combination of two recognized abnormali- ties: ataxia (lack of muscle control) and telangiectasia (abnormal dilatation of capillary vessels that often result in tumors and red skin lesions). However, A-T involves more than just the sum of these two findings. Other associated A-T problems include immune system deficiencies, extreme sensitivity to radiation, and blood cancers. | No
8602 | NarrativeText | Medical researchers initially suspected that multiple genes (the units responsible for inherited features) were involved. However, in 1995, mutations in a single large gene were identified as causing A-T. Researchers named the gene ATM for A-T, mutated. Subsequent research revealed that ATM has a significant role in regulating cell division. The symptoms associated with A-T reflect the main role of the AT gene, which is to induce several cellu- lar responses to DNA damage, such as preventing damaged DNA from being reproduced. When the AT gene is mutated into ATM, the signaling networks are affected and the cell no longer responds correctly to minimize the damage. | No
8603 | NarrativeText | A-T is very rare, but it occurs in every population world wide, with an estimated frequency of between 1/40,000 and 1/100,000 live births. But it is believed that many A-T cases, particularly those who die at a young age, are never properly diagnosed. Therefore, this disease may actually be much more prevalent. According to the A-T Project Foundation, an estimated 1% (2.5 million in the United States) of the general population carries defec- tive A-T genes. Carriers of one copy of this gene do not develop A-T, but have a significantly increased risk of cancer. This makes the A-T gene one of the most impor- tant cancer-related genes identified to date. | No
8604 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
8605 | NarrativeText | The ATM gene is autosomal recessive, meaning the disease occurs only if a defective gene is inherited from both parents. Infants with A-T initially often appear very healthy. At around age two, ataxia and nervous system abnormalities becomes apparent. The root cause of A-T- associated ataxia is cell death in the brain, specifically the large branching cells of the nervous system (Purkin- je’s cells) which are located in the cerebellum. A toddler becomes clumsy, loses balance easily and lacks muscle control. Speech becomes slurred and more difficult, and the symptoms progressively worsen. Between ages two | No

8607 | NarrativeText | and eight, telangiectases, or tiny, red “spider” veins, appear on the cheeks and ears and in the eyes. | No
8608 | NarrativeText | By age 10-12, children with A-T can no longer control their muscles. Immune system deficiencies become com- mon, and affected individuals are extremely sensitive to radiation. Immune system deficiencies vary between indi- viduals but include lower-than-normal levels of proteins that function as antibodies (immunoglobulins) and white blood cells (blood cells not containing “iron”’ proteins). The thymus gland, which aids in development of the body’s immune system, is either missing or has developed abnor- mally. Intelligence is normal, but growth may be retarded owing to immune system or hormonal deficiencies. Indi- viduals with A-T are also sometimes afflicted with dia- betes, prematurely graying hair, and difficulty swallowing. As the children grow older, the immune system becomes weaker and less capable of fighting infection. In the later stages, recurrent respiratory infections and blood cancers, such as leukemia or lymphoma, are common. | No
8609 | Title | Diagnosis | No
8610 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis relies on recognizing the hallmarks of A- T: progressive ataxia and telangiectasia. However, this may be difficult as ataxia symptoms do appear prior to telangiectasia symptoms by several years. Other symp- toms can vary between individuals; for example, 70% of individuals with A-T have a high incidence of respiratory infection, 30% do not. The identification of the ATM gene raises hopes that screening, and perhaps treatment, may be possible. | No
8611 | Title | Treatment | No
8612 | NarrativeText | There is currently no cure for A-T, and treatment focuses on managing the individual’s multiple symp- toms. Physical therapy and speech therapy can help the patient adjust to ataxia. Injections of gamma globulin, or extracts of human blood that contain antibodies, are used to strengthen the weakened immune system. High-dose vitamin administrations may also be prescribed. Research continues in many countries to find effective treatments. Individuals and families living with this dis- order may benefit from attending support groups. | No

8614 | NarrativeText | A-T is a fatal condition. Children with A-T become physically disabled by their early teens and typically die by their early 20s, usually from the associated blood can- cers and malignancies. In very rare cases, individuals with A-T may experience slower progression and a slightly longer life span, surviving into their 30s.

8651 | Title | Description | No
8652 | NarrativeText | Atelectasis can result from an obstruction (block- age) of the airways that affects tiny air scas called alve- oli. Alveoli are very thin-walled and contain a rich blood supply. They are important for lung function, since their purpose is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. When the airways are blocked by a mucous “plug,” for- eign object, or tumor, the alveoli are unable to fill with air and collapse of lung tissue can occur in the affected area. Atelectasis is a potential complication following surgery, especially in individuals who have undergone chest or abdominal operations resulting in associated abdominal or chest pain during breathing. Congenital atelectasis can result from a failure of the lungs to expand at birth. This congenital condition may be local- ized or may affect all of both lungs. | No
8653 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
8654 | NarrativeText | Causes of atelectasis include insufficient attemps at respiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction, or absence of surfactant (a substance secreted by alveoli that maintains the stability of lung tissue by reducing the surface tension of fluids that coat the lung). This lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing it to collapse if severe. Pressure on the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by thick mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases. Tumors and | No
8655 | Title | 390 | No
8656 | NarrativeText | inhaled objects can also cause obstruction of the airway, leading to atelectasis. | No
8657 | NarrativeText | Anyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgery using general anesthesia is at risk to develop atelectasis, since breathing is often shallow after surgery to avoid pain from the surgical incision. Any significant decrease in airflow to the alveoli contributes to pooling of secre- tions, which in turn can cause infection. Chest injuries causing shallow breathing, including fractured ribs, can cause atelectasis. Common symptoms of atelectasis include shortness of breath and decreased chest wall expansion. If atelectasis only afects a small area of the lung, symptoms are ususally minimal. If the condition affects a large area of the lung and develops quickly, the individual may turn blue (cyanotic) or pale, have extreme shortness of breath, and feel a stabbing pain on the affected side. Fever and increased heart rate may be pre- sent if infection accompanies atelectasis. | No
8658 | Title | Diagnosis | No
8659 | NarrativeText | To diagnose atelectasis, a doctor starts by recording the patient’s symptoms and performing a thorough phys- ical examination. When the doctor listens to the lungs through a stethoscope (ausculation), diminished or bronchial breath sounds may be heard. By tapping on the chest (percussion) while listening through the stetho- scope, the doctor can often tell if the lung is collapsed. A chest x ray that shows an airless area in the lung con- firms the diagnosis of atelectasis. If an obstruction of the airways is suspected, a computed tomography scan (CT) or bronchoscopy may be performed to locate the cause of the blockage. | No
8660 | Title | Treatment | No
8661 | NarrativeText | If atelectasis is due to obstruction of the airway, the first step in treatment is to remove the cause of the block- age. This may be done by coughing, suctioning, or bron- choscopy. If a tumor is the cause of atelectasis, surgery may be necessary to remove it. Antibiotics are commonly used to fight the infection that often accompanies atelec- tasis. In cases where recurrent or long-lasting infection is disabling or where significant bleeding occurs, the affect- ed section of the lung may be surgically removed. | No
8662 | Title | Prognosis | No
8663 | NarrativeText | If atelectasis is caused by a thick mucus “plug” or inhaled foreign object, the patient usually recovers com- pletely when the blockage is removed. If it is caused by a tumor, the outcome depends on the nature of the tumor involved. If atelectasis is a result of surgery, other post-oper- ative conditions and/or complications affect the prognosis. | No

Coughing and breathing deeply every one to two hours after any surgical operation with gen- eral anesthesia is recommended. Breathing exercises and the use of breathing devices, such as an incentive spirometer, may also help prevent atelectasis. Although smokers have a higher risk of developing atelectasis following surgery, stopping smoking six to eight weeks before surgery can help reduce the risk. Increasing fluid intake during respiratory illness or after surgery (by mouth or intravenously) helps lung secretions to remain loose. Increasing humidity may also be beneficial. | No

8693 | NarrativeText | The types of atherectomy are rotational, directional, and transluminal extraction. Rotational atherectomy uses a high speed rotating shaver to grind up plaque. Directional atherectomy was the first type approved, but is no longer commonly used; it scrapes plaque into an opening in one side of the catheter. Transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy uses a device that cuts plaque off vessel walls and vacuums it into a bottle. It is used to clear bypass grafts. | No
8694 | NarrativeText | Performed in a cardiac catheterization lab, atherec- tomy is also called removal of plaque from the coronary arteries. It can be used instead of, or along with, balloon angioplasty. Atherectomy is successful about 95% of the time. Plaque forms again in 20-30% of patients. | No
8695 | NarrativeText | Atherectomy uses a rotating shaver or other device placed on the end of a catheter to slice away or destroy plaque. At the beginning of the procedure, medications to control blood pressure, dilate the coronary arteries, and prevent blood clots are administered. The patient is awake but sedated. The catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin, leg, or arm, and threaded through the blood vessels into the blocked coronary artery. The cutting head is positioned against the plaque and activated, and the plaque is ground up or suctioned out. | No

8722 | NarrativeText | Atherosclerosis is the build up of a waxy plaque on the inside of blood vessels. In Greek, athere means gruel, and skleros means hard. Atherosclerosis is often called arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis (from the Greek arteria, meaning artery) is a general term for hardening of the arteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur in several forms, including atherosclerosis. | No
8723 | Title | Description | No
8724 | NarrativeText | Atherosclerosis, a progressive process responsible for most heart disease, is a type of arteriosclerosis or hardening of the arteries. An artery is made up of several layers: an inner lining called the endothelium, an elastic membrane that allows the artery to expand and contract, a layer of smooth muscle, and a layer of connective tis- sue. Arteriosclerosis is a broad term that includes a hard- ening of the inner and middle layers of the artery. It can be caused by normal aging, by high blood pressure, and by diseases such as diabetes. Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis that affects only the inner lining of an artery. It is characterized by plaque deposits that block the flow of blood. | No
8725 | NarrativeText | Plaque is made of fatty substances, cholesterol, waste products from the cells, calcium, and fibrin, a stringy material that helps clot blood. The plaque forma- tion process stimulates the cells of the artery wall to pro- duce substances that accumulate in the inner layer. Fat builds up within these cells and around them, and they form connective tissue and calcium. The inner layer of the artery wall thickens, the artery’s diameter is reduced, and blood flow and oxygen delivery are decreased. Plaques can rupture or crack open, causing the sudden formation of a blood clot (thrombosis). Atherosclerosis | No
8726 | Title | 393 | No
8727 | NarrativeText | can cause a heart attack if it completely blocks the blood flow in the heart (coronary) arteries. It can cause a stroke if it completely blocks the brain (carotid) arteries. Atherosclerosis can also occur in the arteries of the neck, kidneys, thighs, and arms, causing kidney failure or gan- grene and amputation. | No
8728 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
8729 | NarrativeText | Atherosclerosis can begin in the late teens, but it usually takes decades to cause symptoms. Some people experience rapidly progressing atherosclerosis during their thirties, others during their fifties or sixties. Athero- sclerosis is complex. Its exact cause is still unknown. It is thought that atherosclerosis is caused by a response to damage to the endothelium from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and cigarette smoking. A person who has all three of these risk factors is eight times more likely to develop atherosclerosis than is a person who has none. Physical inactivity, diabetes, and obesity are also risk factors for atherosclerosis. High levels of the amino acid homocysteine and abnormal levels of protein-coated fats called lipoproteins also raise the risk of coronary artery disease. These substances are the targets of much current research. The role of triglycerides, another fat that circu- lates in the blood, in forming atherosclerotic plaques is unclear. High levels of triglycerides are often associated with diabetes, obesity, and low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL cholesterol). The more HDL (“good”) cholesterol, in the blood, the less likely is coronary artery disease. These risk factors are all modifiable. Non-modi- fiable risk factors are heredity, sex, and age. | No
8730 | NarrativeText | Risk factors that can be changed: + Cigarette/tobacco smoke—Smoking increases both the chance of developing atherosclerosis and the chance of dying from coronary heart disease. Second hand smoke may also increase risk. | No
8731 | ListItem | ¢ High blood cholesterol—Cholesterol, a soft, waxy sub- stance, comes from foods such as meat, eggs, and other animal products and is produced in the liver. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect cholesterol. Total blood choles- terol is considered high at levels above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200-239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low- density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) begin at 130-159 mg/dL. | No
8732 | ListItem | ¢ High triglycerides—Moost fat in food and in the body takes the form of triglycerides. Blood triglyceride lev- els above 400 mg/dL have been linked to coronary artery disease in some people. Triglycerides, however, are not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol. | No
8733 | Title | 394 | No
8734 | ListItem | ¢ High blood pressure—Blood pressure of 140 over 90 or higher makes the heart work harder, and over time, both weakens the heart and harms the arteries. | No
8735 | ListItem | + Physical inactivity—Lack of exercise increases the risk of atherosclerosis. | No
8736 | ListItem | * Diabetes mellitus—The risk of developing atheroscle- rosis is seriously increased for diabetics and can be lowered by keeping diabetes under control. Most dia- betics die from heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis. | No
8737 | ListItem | * Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on the heart and increases the risk of developing atherosclero- sis even if no other risk factors are present. | No
8738 | NarrativeText | Risk factors that cannot be changed: * Heredity—People whose parents have coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, or stroke at an early age are at increased risk. The high rate of severe hypertension among African-Americans puts them at increased risk. | No
8739 | ListItem | * Sex—Before age 60, men are more likely to have heart attacks than women are. After age 60, the risk is equal among men and women. | No
8740 | ListItem | * Age—Risk is higher in men who are 45 years of age and older and women who are 55 years of age and older. | No
8741 | NarrativeText | Symptoms differ depending upon the location of the atherosclerosis. | No
8742 | ListItem | + In the coronary (heart) arteries: Chest pain, heart attack, or sudden death. | No

8747 | NarrativeText | Physicians may be able to make a diagnosis of athero- sclerosis during a physical exam by means of a stetho- scope and gentle probing of the arteries with the hand (pal- pation). More definite tests are electrocardiography, echocardiography or ultrasonography of the arteries (for example, the carotids), radionuclide scans, and angiogra- phy. | No
8748 | NarrativeText | An electrocardiogram shows the heart’s activity. Elec- trodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient’s body. They send impulses of the heart to a recorder. The test takes about 10 minutes and is performed in a physician’s office. Exercise electrocardiography (stress test) is conducted while the patient exercises on a treadmill High cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, viruses, cigarette smoking, etc., cause injuries to the lining of the artery, creating areas where higher levels of lipids are trapped. | No

A technician applies gel to a hand-held transduc- er, presses it against the patient’s chest, and images are displayed on a monitor. This technique cannot evaluate the coronary arteries directly. They are too small and are in motion with the heart. Severe coronary artery disease, however, may cause abnormal heart motion that is detected by echocardiography. Performed in a cardiology outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test takes 30-60 minutes. Ultrasonography is also used to assess arteries of the neck and thighs. | No
8757 | NarrativeText | Radionuclide angiography and thallium (or ses- tamibi) scanning enable physicians to see the blood flow through the coronary arteries and the heart chambers. Radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream. A device that uses gamma rays to produce an image of the radioactive material (gamma camera) records pictures of the heart. Radionuclide angiography is usually performed in a hospital’s nuclear medicine department and takes 30- 60 minutes. Thallium scanning is usually done after an exercise stress test or after injection of a vasodilator, a drug to enlarge the blood vessels, like dipyridamole (Per- santine). Thallium is injected, and the scan is done then and again four hours (and possibly 24 hours) later. Thalli- um scanning is usually performed in a hospital’s nuclear medicine department. Each scan takes 30-60 minutes. | No
8758 | NarrativeText | Coronary angiography is the most accurate diagnos- tic method and the only one that requires entering the body (invasive procedure). A cardiologist inserts a catheter equipped with a viewing device into a blood ves- sel in the leg or arm and guides it into the heart. The patient has been given a contrast dye that makes the heart visible to x rays. Motion pictures are taken of the con- trast dye flowing though the arteries. Plaques and block- ages, if present, are well defined. The patient is awake but has been given a sedative. Coronary angiography is performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory and takes from 30 minutes to two hours. | No
8759 | Title | Treatment | No
8760 | NarrativeText | Treatment includes lifestyle changes, lipid-lowering drugs, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Atherosclerosis requires lifelong care. | No
8761 | NarrativeText | Patients who have less severe atherosclerosis may achieve adequate control through lifestyle changes and drug therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that prevent disease progression—a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, los- ing weight (if necessary), exercise, controlling blood pressure, and not smoking—also help prevent the disease. | No
8762 | NarrativeText | Most of the drugs prescribed for atherosclerosis seek to lower cholesterol. Many popular lipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL-cholesterol by an average of 25-30% when combined with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Lipid-lowering drugs include bile acid resins, “statins” (drugs that effect HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme that controls the processing of cholesterol), niacin, and fibric acid derivatives such as gemfibrozil (Lobid). Aspirin helps prevent thrombosis and a variety of other medica- tions can be used to treat the effects of atherosclerosis. | No
8763 | NarrativeText | Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery are invasive procedures that improve blood flow in the coronary arteries. Percutaneous translu- minal coronary angioplasty (coronary angioplasty) is a non-surgical procedure in which a catheter tipped with a balloon is threaded from a blood vessel in the thigh into the blocked artery. The balloon is inflated, compresses the plaque to enlarge the blood vessel, and opens the blocked artery. Coronary angioplasty is performed by a cardiolo- gist in a hospital and generally requires a hospital stay of one or two days. It is successful about 90% of the time, but for one-third of patients the artery narrows again with- in six months. It can be repeated and a “stent” may be placed in the artery to help keep it open (see below). | No

8766 | NarrativeText | heart. It is major surgery appropriate for patients with blockages in two or three major coronary arteries or severely narrowed left main coronary arteries, and for those who have not responded to other treatments. It is performed in a hospital under general anesthesia and uses a heart-lung machine. About 70% of patients experi- ence full relief; about 20% partial relief. | No
8767 | NarrativeText | Three other semi-experimental surgical procedures may be used to treat atherosclerosis. In atherectomy, a cardiologist shaves off and removes strips of plaque from the blocked artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a laser tip is inserted to burn or break down the plaque. A metal coil called a stent may be permanently implanted to keep a blocked artery open. | No
8768 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
8769 | NarrativeText | Alternative therapies that focus on diet and lifestyle can help prevent, retard, or reverse atherosclerosis. Herbal therapies that may be helpful include: hawthorn (Cratae- gus laevigata), notoginseng root (Panax notoginseng), garlic (Allium sativum), ginger (Zingiber officinale), hot red or chili peppers, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and alfalfa (Medicago sativum). Relaxation techniques including yoga, meditation, guided imagery, biofeed- back, and counseling and other “talking” therapies may also be useful to prevent or slow the progress of the dis- ease. Dietary modifications focus on eating foods that are low in fats (especially saturated fats), cholesterol, sugar, and animal proteins and high in fiber and antioxidants (found in fresh fruits and vegetables). Liberal use of onions and garlic is recommended, as is eating raw and cooked fish, especially cold-water fish like salmon. Smoking, alcohol, and stimulants like coffee should be avoided. Chelation therapy, which uses anticoagulant drugs and nutrients to dissolve plaque and flush it through the kidneys, is controversial. Long-term remedies can be prescribed by specialists in ayurvedic medicine, which combines diet, herbal remedies, relaxation and exercise, and homeopathy, which treats a disease with small doses of a drug that causes the symptoms of the disease. | No
8770 | Title | Prognosis | No
8771 | NarrativeText | Atherosclerosis can be successfully treated but not cured. Recent clinical studies have shown that athero- sclerosis can be delayed, stopped, and even reversed by aggressively lowering LDL cholesterol. New diagnostic techniques enable physicians to identify and treat athero- sclerosis in its earliest stages. New technologies and sur- gical procedures have extended the lives of many patients who would otherwise have died. Research continues. | No
8772 | Title | Prevention | No
8773 | NarrativeText | A healthy lifestyle—eating right, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and control- ling hypertension—can reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis, help keep the disease from progressing, and sometimes cause it to regress. | No
8774 | ListItem | + Eat right-A healthy diet reduces excess levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. It includes a variety of foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and high in fiber; plenty of fruits and vegetables; and limited sodi- um. Fat should comprise no more than 30%, and saturat- ed fat no more than 8-10%, of total daily calories according to the American Heart Association. Choles- terol should be limited to about 300 milligrams per day and sodium to about 2,400 milligrams. The “Food Guide” Pyramid developed by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services provides daily guidelines: 6-11 servings of bread, cereal, rice, and pasta; 3-5 servings of vegetables; 2-4 servings of fruit; 2-3 servings of milk, yogurt, and cheese; and 2-3 serv- ings of meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. Fats, oils, and sweets should be used sparingly. Mono- unsaturated oils, like olive and rapeseed (Canola) are good alternatives to use for cooking. | No
8775 | ListItem | Exercise regularly—Aerobic exercise can lower blood pressure, help control weight, and increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol. It may keep the blood vessels more flexible. Moderate to intense aerobic exercise lasting about 30 minutes (or three 10-minute exercise periods) four or more times per week is recommended, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention and the American College of Sports Medicine. Aerobic exercise includes walking, jogging, and cycling, active gardening, climbing stairs, or brisk housework. A physician should be consulted before exercise if a person has atherosclerosis or is at increased risk for it. | No
8776 | ListItem | ¢ Maintain a desirable body weight—Losing weight can help reduce total and LDL cholesterol, reduce triglyc- erides, and boost HDL cholesterol. It may also reduce blood pressure. Eating right and exercising are two key components in maintaining a desirable body weight. | No
8777 | ListItem | * Do not smoke or use tobacco—Smoking has many adverse effects on the heart but quitting can repair damage. Ex-smokers face the same risk of heart dis- ease as non-smokers within five to 10 years of quitting. Smoking is the worst thing a person can do to their heart and lungs. | No

8807 | Title | Description | No
8808 | NarrativeText | Athlete’s foot is a very common condition of itchy, peeling skin on the feet. In fact, it’s so common that most people will have at least one episode at least once in their lives. It’s less often found in women and children under age 12. (Symptoms that look like athlete’s foot in young children most probably are caused by some other skin condition). | No

8813 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
8814 | NarrativeText | Athlete’s foot is caused by a fungal infection that most often affects the fourth and fifth toe webs. Trichophy- ton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floc- cosum, the fungi that cause athlete’s foot, are unusual in that they live exclusively on dead body tissue (hair, the outer layer of skin, and nails). The fungus grows best in moist, damp, dark places with poor ventilation. The prob- lem doesn’t occur among people who usually go barefoot. | No
8815 | NarrativeText | Many people carry the fungus on their skin. Howev- er, it will only flourish to the point of causing athlete’s foot if conditions are right. Many people believe athlete’s foot is highly contagious, especially in public swimming pools and shower rooms. Research has shown, however, that it is difficult to pick up the infection simply by walk- ing barefoot over a contaminated damp floor. Exactly why some people develop the condition and others don’t is not well understood. | No
8816 | NarrativeText | Sweaty feet, tight shoes, synthetic socks that don’t absorb moisture well, a warm climate, and not drying the feet well after swimming or bathing, all contribute to the overgrowth of the fungus. | No
8817 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of athlete’s foot include itchy, sore skin on the toes, with scaling, cracking, inflammation, and blisters. Blisters that break, exposing raw patches of tis- sue, can cause pain and swelling. As the infection spreads, itching and burning may get worse. | No
8818 | NarrativeText | If it’s not treated, athlete’s foot can spread to the soles of the feet and toenails. Stubborn toenail infections may appear at the same time, with crumbling, scaling and thickened nails, and nail loss. The infection can spread further if patients scratch and then touch themselves else- Athlete’s foot fungus on toes of patient. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.) | No

8820 | Title | Diagnosis | No
8821 | NarrativeText | Not all foot rashes are athlete’s foot, which is why a physician should diagnose the condition before any remedies are used. Using nonprescription products on a rash that is not athlete’s foot could make the rash worse. | No
8822 | NarrativeText | A dermatologist can diagnose the condition by physical examination and by examining a preparation of skin scrapings under a microscope. This test, called a KOH preparation, treats a sample of tissue scraped from the infected area with heat and potassium hydroxide (KOH). This treatment dissolves certain substances in the tissue sample, making it possible to see the fungi under the microscope. | No
8823 | Title | Treatment | No
8824 | NarrativeText | Athlete’s foot may be resistant to medication and should not be ignored. Simple cases usually respond well to antifungal creams or sprays (clotrimazole, ketocona- zole, miconazole nitrate, sulconazole nitrate, or tolnaf- tate). If the infection is resistant to topical treatment, the doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug. | No

8831 | NarrativeText | Athlete’s foot usually responds well to treatment, but it is important to take all medication as directed by a dermatologist, even if the skin appears to be free of fun- gus. Otherwise, the infection could return. The toenail infections that may accompany athlete’s foot, however, are typically very hard to treat effectively | No

8850 | NarrativeText | Athletic heart syndrome is the adaptation of an ath- lete’s heart in response the physiologic stresses of strenu- ous physical training. It can be difficult to distinguish a significant medical condition from an athletic heart. | No
8851 | Title | Description | No
8852 | NarrativeText | The heart adapts to physical demands by enlarging, especially the left ventricle. Enlargement increases the cardiac output, the amount of blood pumped with each beat of the heart. The exact type of adaptation depends on the nature of the physical demand. There are two types of demand, static and dynamic. Static demand involves smaller groups of muscles under extreme resis- tance for brief period. An example is weight lifting. Dynamic training involves larger groups of muscles at lower resistance for extended periods of time. Examples are aerobic training and tennis. Cardiac enlargement is associated with dynamic training. The heart’s response to static training is hypertrophy, thickening of the muscle walls of the heart. As the wall of the heart adapts, there are changes in the electrical conducting system of the heart. Because of the larger volume of blood being pumped with each heart beat, the heart rate when at rest decreases below the normal level for nonathletes. | No
8853 | NarrativeText | Sudden unexpected death (SUD) is the death of an athlete, usually during or shortly after physical activity. Often, there is no warning that the person will experience SUD, although in some cases, warning signs appear which cause the person to seek medical advice. Impor- tantly, cases of death occurring during physical activity are not caused by athletic heart syndrome, but by undiag- nosed heart disorders. | No

8858 | Title | Diagnosis | No
8859 | NarrativeText | The changes in the heart beat caused by the electri- cal conduction system of the heart are detectable on an electrocardiogram. Many of the changes seen in athletic heart syndrome mimic those of various heart diseases. Careful examination must be made to distinguish heart disease from athletic heart syndrome. | No

8861 | NarrativeText | The yearly rate for occurrence of SUD in people less than 35 years of age is less than seven incidents per 100,000. Of all SUD cases, only about 8% are exercise related. On a national basis, this means that each year approximately 25 athletes experience SUD. In persons over age 35, the incidence of SUD is approximately 55 in 100,000, with only 3% of the cases occurring during exercise. | No

8872 | NarrativeText | The primary benefit of the diet is rapid and substan- tial weight loss. By restricting carbohydrate intake, the body will burn more fat stored in the body.

8875 | NarrativeText | Dr. Robert C. Atkins graduated from the University of Michigan in 1951 and received his medical degree from Cornell University Medical School in 1955 with a specialty in cardiology. As an internist and cardiologist he developed the Atkins Diet in the early 1970s. The diet is a ketogenic diet—a high protein, high fat, and very low carbohydrate regimen resulting in ketosis. It empha- sizes meat, cheese, and eggs, while discouraging foods such as bread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It first came to pub- lic attention in 1972 with the publication of Dr. Atkins’ Diet Revolution. The book quickly became a bestseller but unlike most other fad diet books, this one has remained popular. At last count, it had been reprinted 28 times and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. Since then, Atkins has authored a number of other books on his diet theme, including Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revo- lution (1992), Dr. Atkins’ Quick and Easy New Diet Cookbook (1997), and The Vita-Nutrient Solution: Nature’s Answer to Drugs (1998). | No
8876 | NarrativeText | Atkins has seen about 60,000 patients in his more than 30 years of practice. He has also appeared on numer- ous radio and television talk shows, has his own syndicat- ed radio program, Your Health Choices, and authors the monthly newsletter Dr. Atkins’ Health Revelations. Atkins has received the World Organization of Alternative Medi- cine’s Recognition of Achievement Award and been named the National Health Federation’s Man of the Year. He is director of the Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine which he founded in the early 1980s. The center is located at 152 E. 55th St., New York, NY 10022. | No
8877 | NarrativeText | conditions such as fatigue, irritability, headaches, depres- sion, and some types of joint and muscle pain. | No
8878 | Title | Description | No
8879 | NarrativeText | The regimen is a low-carbohydrate, or ketogenic diet, characterized by initial rapid weight loss, usually due to water loss. Drastically reducing the amount of car- bohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen loss, which has a strong but temporary diuretic effect. Long- term weight loss occurs because with a low amount of carbohydrate intake, the body burns stored fat for energy. | No
8880 | NarrativeText | The four-step diet starts with a two-week induction program designed to rebalance an individual’s metabo- lism. Unlimited amounts of fat and protein are allowed but carbohydrate intake is restricted to 15-20 grams per day. Foods allowed include butter, oil, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, and cream. The daily amount of carbohy- drates allowed equals about three cups of salad vegeta- bles, such as lettuce, cucumbers, and celery. | No
8881 | NarrativeText | The second stage is for ongoing weight loss. It allows 15-40 grams of carbohydrates a day. When the individual is about 10 pounds from their desired weight, they begin the pre-maintenance phase. This gradually adds one to three servings a week of high carbohydrate foods, such as a piece of fruit or slice of whole-wheat bread. When the desired weight is reached, the mainte- nance stage begins. It allows 40-60 grams of carbohy- drates per day. | No
8882 | NarrativeText | Opinion from the general medical community remains mixed on the Atkins diet, but is generally unfa- vorable. There have been no significant long-term scien- tific studies on the diet. A number of leading medical and health organizations, including the American Medical Association, American Dietetic Association (ADA), and the American Heart Association oppose it. It is drastical- ly different than the dietary intakes recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Insti- tutes of Health. Much of the opposition is because the diet is lacking in some vitamins and nutrients, and because it is high in fat. In a hearing before the U.S. Con- gress on February 24, 2000, an ADA representative called the Atkins diet “hazardous” and said it lacked sci- entific credibility. | No
8883 | Title | Preparations | No
8884 | NarrativeText | No advance preparation is needed to go on the diet. However, as with most diets, it is generally considered appropriate to consult with a physician and to have a physical evaluation before starting such a nutritional reg- imen. The evaluation should include blood tests to deter- mine levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and uric acid. A glucose tolerance test is also recom- mended. | No
8885 | Title | Precautions | No
8886 | NarrativeText | Adherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitamin and mineral deficiencies. In his books, Atkins recom- mends a wide-range of nutritional supplements, includ- ing a multi-vitamin. Among his recommendations, Atkins suggests the following daily dosages: 300-600 micrograms (mcg) of chromium picolinate, 100-400 mil- ligrams (mg) of pantetheine, 200 mcg of selenium, and 450-675 mcg of biotin. | No
8887 | NarrativeText | The diet is not recommended for lacto-ovo vegetari- ans, since it cannot be done as successfully without pro- tein derived from animal products. Also, vegans cannot follow this diet, since a vegan diet is too high in carbohy- drates, according to Atkins. Instead, he recommends veg- etarians with a serious weight problem give up vegetari- anism, or at least include fish in their diet. | No
8888 | Title | Side effects | No
8889 | NarrativeText | According to Atkins, the diet causes no adverse side effects. Many health care professionals disagree. In a fact sheet for the Healthcare Reality Check Web site (http://www.hcrc.org), Ellen Coleman, a registered dieti- cian and author, said the diet may have serious side effects for some people. She said complications associat- ed with the diet include ketosis, dehydration, electrolyte loss, calcium depletion, weakness, nausea, and kidney problems. “It is certainly riskier for overweight individu- als with medical problems such as heart disease, hyper- tension, kidney disease, and diabetes than it is for over- weight people with no health problems,” she said. | No

8921 | Title | Description | No
8922 | NarrativeText | Atopic dermatitis refers to a wide range of diseases that are often associated with stress and allergic disor- ders that involve the respiratory system, like asthma and hay fever. Although atopic dermatitis can appear at any age, it is most common in children and young adults. Symptoms usually abate before the age of 25 and do not affect the patient’s general health. | No
8923 | NarrativeText | About one in ten babies develop a form of atopic dermatitis called infantile eczema. Characterized by skin that oozes and becomes encrusted, infantile eczema most often occurs on the face and scalp. The condition usually improves before the child’s second birthday, and medical attention can keep symptoms in check until that time. | No
8924 | NarrativeText | When atopic dermatitis develops after infancy, inflammation, blistering, oozing, and crusting are less pronounced. The patient’s sores become dry, turn from red to brownish-gray, and skin may thicken and become scaly. In dark-skinned individuals, this condition can cause the complexion to lighten or darken. Itching asso- ciated with this condition is usually worst at night. It can be so intense that patients scratch until their sores bleed, sometimes causing scarring and infection. | No
8925 | NarrativeText | Atopic dermatitis affects about 3% of the population of the United States, and about 80% of the people who have the condition have one or more relatives with the same condition or a similar one. Symptoms tend to be most severe in females. Atopic dermatitis can erupt on any part of the skin, and crusted, thickened patches on the fingers, palms, or the soles of the feet can last for years. In teenagers and young adults, atopic dermatitis often appears on one or more of the following areas: * elbow creases * backs of the knees | No

8942 | Title | Treatment | No
8943 | NarrativeText | Atopic dermatitis cannot be cured, but the severity and duration of symptoms can be controlled. A dermatol- ogist should be consulted when symptoms first appear, and is likely to recommend warm baths to loosen encrusted skin, followed by applications of petroleum jelly or vegetable shortening to prevent the skin’s natural moisture from escaping. | No
8944 | NarrativeText | Externally applied (topical) steroids or preparations containing coal tar can relieve minor itching, but coal tar has an unpleasant odor, stains clothes, and may increase skin-cancer risk. Excessive use of steroid creams in young children can alter growth. Pregnant women should not use products that contain coal tar. Topical steroids can cause itching, burning, acne, permanent stretch marks, and thinning and spotting of the skin. Applying topical steroids to the area around the eyes can cause glaucoma. | No
8945 | NarrativeText | Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can relieve symptoms of allergy-related atopic dermatitis. More concentrated topical steroids are recom- mended for persistent symptoms. A mild tranquilizer may be prescribed to reduce stress and help the patient sleep, and antibiotics are used to treat secondary infections. | No
8946 | NarrativeText | Cortisone ointments should be used sparingly, and strong preparations should never be applied to the face, groin, armpits, or rectal area. Regular medical monitor- ing is recommended for patients who use cortisone salves or lotions to control wide-spread symptoms. Oral cortisone may be prescribed if the patient does not respond to other treatments, but patients who take the medication for more than two weeks have a greater-than- average risk of developing severe symptoms when the treatment is discontinued. | No
8947 | NarrativeText | Allergy shots rarely improve atopic dermatitis and sometimes aggravate the symptoms. Since food allergies may trigger atopic dermatitis, the doctor may suggest eliminating certain foods from the diet if other treatments prove ineffective. | No
8948 | NarrativeText | If symptoms are extremely severe, ultraviolet light therapy may be prescribed, and a wet body wrap recom- mended to help the skin retain moisture. This technique, used most often with children, involves sleeping in a warm room while wearing wet pajamas under dry cloth- ing, rain gear, or a nylon sweatsuit. The patient’s face may be covered with wet gauze covered by elastic bandages, and his hands encased in wet socks covered by dry ones. | No

8981 | NarrativeText | Atrial ectopic beats (AEB) refers to a contraction of the upper heart chamber which occurs before it would be expected. Atrial ectopic beats are also known as prema- ture atrial beats, premature atrial complex (PAC), or atri- al extrasystole. | No
8982 | Title | Description | No
8983 | NarrativeText | An AEB is usually a harmless disturbance in the normal rhythm of the heart. It can occur only occasional- ly, in a regular pattern, or several may occur in sequence and then disappear. Most often, the person is unaware of the event. | No
8984 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
8985 | NarrativeText | As people age, extra beats tend to happen more fre- quently even in perfectly healthy individuals. AEB may be triggered or increased by stress, caffeine, smoking, and some medicines. Cold remedies containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine have been known to increase the inci- dence of atrial ectopic beats. AEB may also be the result of an enlarged atria, lung disease, or the result of reduced blood supply to that area of the heart. | No
8986 | Title | 406 | No
8987 | NarrativeText | If a person is aware of the event, the first symptom of AEB is usually a feeling that the heart has skipped or missed a beat. This is often accompanied by a feeling that the heart is thumping or pounding in the chest. The thumping or pounding is caused by the fact that when there is an AEB, the pause before the next beat is usually longer than normal. The next beat must be stronger than usual to pump the accumulated blood out of the chamber. | No
8988 | Title | Diagnosis | No
8989 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of AEB is often suspected on the basis of the patient’s description of the occurrence. An electrocar- diogram (ECG) can confirm the diagnosis. An ECG shows the heart beat as three wave forms. The first wave is called P, the second is called QRS, and the last is T. An atrial ectopic beat will show up on the ECG as a P wave that occurs closer than usual to the preceding T wave. | No
8990 | Title | Treatment | No
8991 | NarrativeText | Atrial ectopic beats do not usually require treatment. If treatment is necessary because the beats occur fre- quently and cause intolerable discomfort, the doctor may prescribe medication. | No
8992 | Title | Prognosis | No
8993 | NarrativeText | Occasional AEB usually have no significance. If they increase in frequency, they can lead to atrial tachy- cardia or fibrillation and to a decrease in cardiac output. | No

9004 | NarrativeText | Atrial fibrillation and flutter are abnormal heart rhythms in which the atria, or upper chambers of the heart, are out of sync with the ventricles, or lower chambers of the heart. In atrial fibrillation, the atria “quiver” chaotical- ly and the ventricles beat irregularly. In atrial flutter, the atria beat regularly and faster than the ventricles. | No
9005 | Title | Description | No
9006 | NarrativeText | Atrial fibrillation and flutter are two types of cardiac arrhythmias, irregularities in the heart’s rhythm. Nearly 2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association. It is the most common chronic arrhythmia. Atrial flutter is less common, but both of these arrhythmias can cause a blood clot to form in the heart. This can lead to a stroke or a blockage car- ried by the blood flow (an embolism) anywhere in the body’s arteries. Atrial fibrillation is responsible for about 15% of strokes. | No
9007 | NarrativeText | The atria are the heart’s two small upper chambers. In atrial fibrillation, the heart beat is completely irregular. The atrial muscles contract very quickly and irregularly; the ventricles, the heart’s two large lower chambers, beat irregularly but not as fast as the atria. When the atria fibril- late, blood that is not completely pumped out can pool and form a clot. In atrial flutter, the heart beat is usually very fast but steady. The atria beat faster than the ventricles. | No
9008 | NarrativeText | Atrial fibrillation often occurs in people with various types of heart disease. Atrial fibrillation may also result from an inflammation of the heart’s covering (pericardi- tis), chest trauma or surgery, pulmonary disease, and cer- tain medications. Atrial fibrillation is more common in older people; about 10% of people over the age of 75 have it. Atrial flutter and fibrillation usually occur in peo- ple with hypertensive or coronary heart disease and other types of heart disorders. | No
9009 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9010 | NarrativeText | In most cases, the cause of atrial fibrillation and flut- ter can be found, but often it cannot. Causes of these heart beat abnormalities include: * many types of heart disease « stress and anxiety | No
9011 | ListItem | + caffeine * alcohol | No
9012 | ListItem | * tobacco ¢ diet pills | No
9013 | ListItem | * some prescription and over-the-counter medications * open heart surgery | No

9016 | ListItem | * pressure or discomfort in the chest + shortness of breath | No
9017 | ListItem | * anxiety. | No
9018 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9019 | NarrativeText | A doctor can sometimes hear these arrhythmias using an instrument (a stethoscope) to listen to the sounds within the chest. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are usually diagnosed through electrocardiography (EKGs), an exercisestress test, a 24-hour Holter EKG monitor, or a telephone cardiac monitor. An EKG shows the heart’s activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen (ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs. The elec- trodes send impulses of the heart’s activity through a monitor (called an oscilloscope) to a recorder that traces the pattern of the impulses onto paper. The test takes about 10 minutes and is performed in a doctor’s office. The exercise stress test measures how the heart and blood vessels respond to work when the patient is exercising on a treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in a doctor’s office within an exercise laboratory and takes 15-30 minutes. | No
9020 | NarrativeText | In 24-hour EKG (Holter) monitoring, the patient wears a small, portable tape recorder connected to disks on his/her chest that record the heart’s rhythm during normal activities. An EKG called transtelephonic moni- toring identifies arrhythmias that occur infrequently. Like Holter monitoring, transtelephonic monitoring continues for days or weeks and enables patients to send the EKG via telephone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia is felt, or to store the information in the recorder and transmit it later. Doctors can also use high- frequency sound waves (echocardiography) to deter- mine the structure and function of the heart. This diag- nostic method is often helpful to evaluate for underlying heart disease. | No
9021 | Title | Treatment | No
9022 | NarrativeText | Atrial fibrillation and flutter are usually treated with medications and/or electrical shock (cardioversion). In some cases, removal of a small portion of the heart (abla- tion), implantation of a pacemaker or a cardioverter defibrillator, or maze surgery is needed. | No
9023 | NarrativeText | If the heart rate cannot be quickly controlled, electri- cal cardioversion may be used. Cardioversion, the elec- tric shock to the chest wall, is usually performed emer- gencies. This device briefly suspends the heart’s activity and allows it to return to a normal rhythm. | No
9024 | NarrativeText | Ablation destroys the heart tissue that causes the arrhythmia. The tissue can be destroyed by catheteriza- tion or surgery. Radiofrequency catheter ablation, per- formed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory, can cure atrial flutter and control the heart rate in atrial fib- rillation. The patient is awake but sedated. A thin tube called a catheter is inserted into a vein and is threaded into the heart. At the end of the catheter, a device maps the electrical pathways of the heart. A cardiologist, a doctor specializing in the heart, uses this map to identify the pathway(s) causing the arrhythmia, and then elimi- nates it (them) with bursts of high-frequency radio waves. Surgical ablation is performed in an operating room under general anesthesia. Computerized mapping techniques are combined with a cold probe to destroy arrhythmia-causing tissue. Ablation is generally suc- cessful. When ablation is used for atrial fibrillation, it is usually followed by implantation of a pacemaker as well as drug therapy. | No
9025 | NarrativeText | A pacemaker is a battery-powered device about the size of a matchbox that is surgically implanted near the collarbone to regulate the heart beat. Lead wires thread- ed to the right side of the heart supply electrical energy to pace the atria and ventricles. The implantable car- dioverter defibrillator is a treatment for serious arrhyth- mias. The battery-powered device senses an abnormal heart rhythm and automatically provides electrical shock(s). The shock(s) suspends heart activity and then allows the heart to initiate a normal rhythm. Wire elec- trodes on the device are attached to the heart. Some of the electrodes are attached to the outside of the heart and some are attached to the inside of the heart through veins. The newest implantable cardioverter defibrilla- tors can be implanted in the chest wall and do not require open chest surgery. These devices weigh less than 10 oz and generally last seven or eight years. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator is usually used with drug therapy, but the amount medication is reduced. In maze surgery, often the last resort, surgeons create a maze of stitches (sutures) that help the heart’s electrical impulses travel effectively. | No
9026 | NarrativeText | Most of the drugs used for treatment have poten- tial side effects and should be carefully monitored by a doctor. The goal of treatment is to control the rate | No
9027 | Title | 408 | No
9028 | NarrativeText | and rhythm of the heart and to prevent the formation of blood clots. If the arrhythmia is caused by heart disease, the heart disease will also be treated. The American Heart Association recommends aggressive treatment. | No
9029 | NarrativeText | A digitalis drug, most commonly digoxin, is usually prescribed to control the heart rate. Digitalis drugs slow the heart’s electrical impulses, helping to restore the nor- mal rate and rhythm. These drugs also increase the abili- ty of the heart’s muscular layer to contract and pump properly. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers can also be used for this purpose. Beta-blockers slow the speed of electrical impulses through the heart. Some cal- cium channel blockers dampen the heart’s response to erratic electrical impulses. | No
9030 | NarrativeText | To prevent blood clots, aspirin or warfarin (Coumadin) is administered. Warfarin, however, has potential bleeding side effects, especially in older patients. Amiodarone is fairly efffective for atrial flutter. This drug is often able to maintain the heart’s proper rhythm and can also help control the heart rate when the flutter occurs. | No
9031 | Title | Prognosis | No
9032 | NarrativeText | Patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter can live a normal life for many years as long as the arrhythmia is controlled and serious blood clots are prevented. | No
9033 | Title | Prevention | No
9034 | NarrativeText | Atrial fibrillation and flutter can sometimes be pre- vented when the cause can be identified and controlled. Depending on the cause, prevention could include: * treating the underlying heart disease * reducing stress and anxiety | No

9063 | Title | Description | No
9064 | NarrativeText | During the normal development of the fetal heart, there is an opening in the wall (the septum) separating the left and right upper chambers of the heart. Normally, this opening closes before birth, but if it does not, the child is born with a hole between the left and right atria. This abnormal opening is called an atrial septal defect and causes blood from the left atrium to flow into the right atrium. | No
9065 | NarrativeText | Different types of atrial septal defects can occur, and they are classified according to where in the separating wall they are found. The most commonly found atrial septal defect occurs in the middle of the atrial septum and accounts for about 70% of all atrial septal defects. Abnormal openings can form in the upper and lower parts of the atrial septum as well. | No
9066 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9067 | NarrativeText | Abnormal openings in the atrial septum occur dur- ing fetal development and are twice as common in females as in males. These abnormalities can go unno- ticed if the opening is small, producing no abnormal symptoms. If the defect is big, large amounts of blood flowing from the left to the right atrium will cause the right atrium to swell to hold the extra blood. | No
9068 | NarrativeText | People born with an atrial septal defect can have no symptoms through their twenties, but by age 40, most people with this condition have symptoms that can include shortness of breath, rapid abnormal beating of the atria (atrial fibrillation), and eventually heart failure. | No
9069 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9070 | NarrativeText | Atrial septal defects can be identified by various methods. Abnormal changes in the sound of the heart beats can be heard when a doctor listens to the heart with a stethoscope. In addition, a chest x ray, an electrocar- diogram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heartbeats), and an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves to form a detailed image of the heart) can also be used to identify this condition. | No

If the heart has an opening between the atria, oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium enters the right atrium. Through cardiac catheterization, doctors can detect the higher-than-normal amount of oxy- gen in the heart’s right atrium, right ventricle, and the large blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs, where the blood would normally subsequently get its oxygen. | No
9079 | Title | Treatment | No
9080 | NarrativeText | Atrial septal defects often correct themselves without medical treatments by the age of two. If this dose not hap- pen, surgery is done by sewing the hole closed, or by sewing a patch of Dacron material or a piece of the sac that surrounds the heart (the pericardium), over the opening. | No
9081 | NarrativeText | Some patients can have the defect fixed by having an clam-shaped plug placed over the opening. This plug is a man-made device that is put in place through a catheter inserted into the heart. | No
9082 | Title | Prognosis | No
9083 | NarrativeText | Individuals with small defects can live a normal life, but larger defects require surgical correction. Less than 1% of people younger than 45 years of age die from cor- rective surgery. Five to ten percent of patients can die from the surgery if they are older than 40 and have other heart-related problems. When an atrial septal defect is corrected within the first 20 years of life, there is an excellent chance for the individual to live normally. | No

9097 | Title | Description | No
9098 | NarrativeText | ADHD, also known as hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) outside of the United States, is estimated to affect 3-9% of children, and afflicts boys more often than girls. Although difficult to assess in infancy and toddlerhood, signs of ADHD may begin to appear as early as age two or three, but the symptom picture changes as adolescence approaches. Many symptoms, particularly hyperactivity, diminish in early adulthood, but impulsivity and inatten- tion problems remain with up to 50% of ADHD individu- als throughout their adult life. | No
9099 | NarrativeText | Children with ADHD have short attention spans, becoming easily bored and/or frustrated with tasks. Although they may be quite intelligent, their lack of focus frequently results in poor grades and difficulties in school. ADHD children act impulsively, taking action first and thinking later. They are constantly moving, running, climbing, squirming, and fidgeting, but often have trouble with gross and fine motor skills and, as a result, may be physically clumsy and awkward. Their clumsiness may extend to the social arena, where they are sometimes shunned due to their impulsive and intrusive behavior. | No
9100 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9101 | NarrativeText | The causes of ADHD are not known. However, it appears that heredity plays a major role in the develop- ment of ADHD. Children with an ADHD parent or sib- ling are more likely to develop the disorder themselves. Before birth, ADHD children may have been exposed to poor maternal nutrition, viral infections, or maternal substance abuse. In early childhood, exposure to lead or other toxins can cause ADHD-like symptoms. Traumatic brain injury or neurological disorders may also trigger ADHD symptoms. Although the exact cause of ADHD is not known, an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters, the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cells, is believed to be the mechanism behind ADHD symptoms. | No
9102 | NarrativeText | A widely publicized study conducted by Dr. Ben Feingold in the early 1970s suggested that allergies to certain foods and food additives caused the characteristic hyperactivity of ADHD children. Although some chil- dren may have adverse reactions to certain foods that can affect their behavior (for example, a rash might tem- porarily cause a child to be distracted from other tasks), carefully controlled follow-up studies have uncovered no link between food allergies and ADHD. Another popular- ly held misconception about food and ADHD is that the consumption of sugar causes hyperactive behavior. Again, studies have shown no link between sugar intake and ADHD. It is important to note, however, that a nutri- tionally balanced diet is important for normal develop- ment in all children. | No
9103 | NarrativeText | Psychologists and other mental health professionals typically use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Sta- tistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) as a guideline for determining the presence of ADHD. For a diagnosis of ADHD, DSM-IV requires the presence of at least six of the following symptoms of inattention, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity combined: Inattention: + fails to pay close attention to detail or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork or other activities + has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or activities | No
9104 | ListItem | + does not appear to listen when spoken to ¢ does not follow through on instructions and does not finish tasks | No
9105 | ListItem | + has difficulty organizing tasks and activities * avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., homework) | No
9106 | ListItem | + is easily distracted is forgetful in daily activities | No
9107 | NarrativeText | Hyperactivity: + fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat * does not remain seated when expected to | No

9110 | ListItem | + talks excessively Impulsivity: ¢ blurts out answers before the question has been com- pleted | No
9111 | ListItem | «has difficulty waiting for his or her turn * interrupts and/or intrudes on others | No
9112 | NarrativeText | DSM-IV also requires that some symptoms develop before age seven, and that they significantly impair func- tioning in two or more settings (e.g., home and school) for a period of at least six months. Children who meet the symptom criteria for inattention, but not for hyperactivi- ty/impulsivity are diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type, commonly called ADD. (Young girls with ADHD may not be diagnosed because they have mainly this subtype of the disorder.) | No
9113 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9114 | NarrativeText | The first step in determining if a child has ADHD is to consult with a pediatrician. The pediatrician can make an initial evaluation of the child’s developmental maturi- ty compared to other children in his or her age group. The physician should also perform a comprehensive physical examination to rule out any organic causes of ADHD symptoms, such as an overactive thyroid or vision or hearing problems. | No
9115 | NarrativeText | If no organic problem can be found, a psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or learning specialist is typically consulted to perform a comprehen- sive ADHD assessment. A complete medical, family, social, psychiatric, and educational history is compiled from existing medical and school records and from interviews with parents and teachers. Interviews may also be conducted with the child, depending on his or her age. Along with these interviews, several clinical inventories may also be used, such as the Conners Rat- ing Scales (Teacher’s Questionnaire and Parent’s Ques- disorder (ADHD) | No

9118 | NarrativeText | It is important to note that mental disorders such as depression and anxiety disorder can cause symptoms similar to ADHD. A complete and comprehensive psy- chiatric assessment is critical to differentiate ADHD from other possible mood and behavioral disorders. Bipolar disorder, for example, may be misdiagnosed, as ADHD. | No
9119 | NarrativeText | Public schools are required by federal law to offer free ADHD testing upon request. A pediatrician can also provide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric specialist for ADHD assessment. Parents should check with their insurance plans to see if these services are covered. | No
9120 | Title | Treatment | No
9121 | NarrativeText | Psychosocial therapy, usually combined with med- ications, is the treatment approach of choice to alleviate ADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants, such as dextroam- phetamine (Dexedrine), pemoline (Cylert), and methyl- phenidate (Ritalin) are commonly prescribed to control hyperactive and impulsive behavior and increase atten- tion span. They work by stimulating the production of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Possible side effects of stimulants include nervous tics, irregular heart- beat, loss of appetite, and insomnia. However, the med- ications are usually well-tolerated and safe in most cases. | No
9122 | NarrativeText | In children who don’t respond well to stimulant ther- apy, tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine (Nor- pramin, Pertofane) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are fre- quently recommended. Reported side effects of these drugs include persistent dry mouth, sedation, disorien- tation, and cardiac arrhythmia (particularly with desipramine). Other medications prescribed for ADHD therapy include buproprion (Wellbutrin), an antidepres- sant; fluoxetine (Prozac), an SSRI antidepressant; and carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), an anticonvulsant drug. Clonidine (Catapres), an antihypertensive medica- tion, has also been used to control aggression and hyper- activity in some ADHD children, although it should not be used with Ritalin. A child’s response to medication will change with age and maturation, so ADHD symp- toms should be monitored closely and prescriptions adjusted accordingly. | No
9123 | NarrativeText | Behavior modification therapy uses a reward system to reinforce good behavior and task completion and can be implemented both in the classroom and at home. A tangible reward such as a sticker may be given to the child every time he completes a task or behaves in an accept- able manner. A chart system may be used to display the stickers and visually illustrate the child’s progress. When a certain number of stickers are collected, the child may trade them in for a bigger reward such as a trip to the zoo or a day at the beach. The reward system stays in place until the good behavior becomes ingrained. | No
9124 | NarrativeText | A variation of this technique, cognitive-behavioral therapy, works to decrease impulsive behavior by get- ting the child to recognize the connection between thoughts and behavior, and to change behavior by chang- ing negative thinking patterns. | No
9125 | NarrativeText | Individual psychotherapy can help an ADHD child build self-esteem, give them a place to discuss their wor- ries and anxieties, and help them gain insight into their behavior and feelings. Family therapy may also be ben- eficial in helping family members develop coping skills and in working through feelings of guilt or anger parents may be experiencing. | No
9126 | NarrativeText | ADHD children perform better within a familiar, consistent, and structured routine with positive reinforce- ments for good behavior and real consequences for bad. Family, friends, and caretakers should all be educated on the special needs and behaviors of the ADHD child. Communication between parents and teachers is espe- cially critical to ensuring an ADHD child has an appro- priate learning environment. | No

9137 | NarrativeText | Untreated, ADHD negatively affects a child’s social and educational performance and can seriously damage his or her sense of self-esteem. ADHD children have impaired relationships with their peers, and may be looked upon as social outcasts. They may be perceived as slow learners or troublemakers in the classroom. Siblings and even parents may develop resentful feelings towards the ADHD child. | No
9138 | NarrativeText | Some ADHD children also develop a conduct disor- der problem. For those adolescents who have both ADHD and a conduct disorder, up to 25% go on to devel- op antisocial personality disorder and the criminal behav- ior, substance abuse, and high rate of suicide attempts that are symptomatic of it. Children diagnosed with ADHD are also more likely to have a learning disorder, a mood disorder such as depression, or an anxiety disorder. | No
9139 | NarrativeText | Approximately 70-80% of ADHD patients treated with stimulant medication experience significant relief from symptoms, at least in the short-term. Approximate- ly half of ADHD children seem to “outgrow” the disor- der in adolescence or early adulthood; the other half will retain some or all symptoms of ADHD as adults. With early identification and intervention, careful compliance with a treatment program, and a supportive and nurturing home and school environment, ADHD children can flourish socially and academically. | No

9161 | NarrativeText | Audiometry is the testing of a person’s ability to hear various sound frequencies. The test is performed with the use of electronic equipment called an audiome- ter. This testing is usually administered by a trained tech- nician called an audiologist. | No
9162 | Title | Purpose | No
9163 | NarrativeText | Audiometry testing is used to identify and diagnose hearing loss.

9168 | Title | Description | No
9169 | NarrativeText | A trained audiologist (a specialist in detecting hear- ing loss) uses an audiometer to conduct audiometry test- ing. This equipment emits sounds or tones, like musical notes, at various frequencies, or pitches, and at differing volumes or levels of loudness. Testing is usually done in a soundproof testing room. | No
9170 | NarrativeText | The person being tested wears a set of headphones that blocks out other distracting sounds and delivers a test tone to one ear at a time. At the sound of a tone, the patient holds up a hand or finger to indicate that the sound is detected. The audiologist lowers the volume and repeats the sound until the patient can no longer detect it. This process is repeated over a wide range of tones or frequencies from very deep, low sounds, like the lowest note played on a tuba, to very high sounds, like the ping- ing of a triangle. Each ear is tested separately. It is not unusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to differ from one ear to the other. | No
9171 | NarrativeText | A second type of audiometry testing uses a headband rather than headphones. The headband is worn with small plastic rectangles that fit behind the ears to conduct sound through the bones of the skull. The patient being tested senses the tones that are transmitted as vibrations through the bones to the inner ear. As with the headphones, the tones are repeated at various frequencies and volumes. | No
9172 | NarrativeText | The results of the audiometry test may be recorded on a grid or graph called an audiogram. This graph is generally set up with low frequencies or tones at one end and high ones at the other end, much like a piano key- board. Low notes are graphed on the left and high notes on the right. The graph also charts the volume of the tones used; from soft, quiet sounds at the top of the chart to loud sounds at the bottom. Hearing is measured in units called decibels. Most of the sounds associated with normal speech patterns are generally spoken in the range of 20-50 decibels. An adult with normal hearing can detect tones between 0-20 decibels. | No
9173 | NarrativeText | Speech audiometry is another type of testing that uses a series of simple recorded words spoken at various volumes into headphones worn by the patient being test- ed. The patient repeats each word back to the audiologist as it is heard. An adult with normal hearing will be able to recognize and repeat 90-100% of the words. | No

9180 | Title | Normal results | No
9181 | NarrativeText | A person with normal hearing will be able to recog- nize and respond to all of the tone frequencies adminis- tered at various volumes in both ears by the audiometry test. An adult with normal hearing can detect a range of low and high pitched sounds that are played as softly as between nearly 0-20 decibels. Normal speech is general- ly spoken in the range of 20-50 decibels. | No
9182 | Title | Abnormal results | No
9183 | NarrativeText | Audiometry test results are considered abnormal if there is a significant or unexplained difference between the levels of sound heard between the two ears, or if the person being tested is unable to hear in the normal range of frequencies and volume. The pattern of responses dis- played on the audiogram can be used by the audiologist to identify if a significant hearing loss is present and if the patient might benefit from hearing aids or corrective surgery. | No

9197 | NarrativeText | Auditory integration training, or AIT, is one specific type of music/auditory therapy based upon the work of French otolaryngologists Dr. Alfred Tomatis and Dr. Guy Berard. | No
9198 | Title | Origins | No
9199 | NarrativeText | The premise upon which most auditory integration programs are based is that distortion in how things are heard contributes to commonly seen behavioral or learning disorders in children. Some of these disorders include attention deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD), autism, dyslexia, and central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Training the patient to listen can stimulate cen- tral and cortical organization. | No
9200 | NarrativeText | Auditory integration is one facet of what audiolo- gists call central auditory processing. The simplest defin- ition of central auditory processing, or CAP, is Universi- ty of Buffalo Professor of Audiology Jack Katz’s, which is: “What we do with what we hear.” Central auditory integration is actually the perception of sound, including the ability to attend to sound, to remember it, retaining it in both the long- and short-term memory, to be able to listen to sound selectively, and to localize it. | No
9201 | NarrativeText | Guy Berard developed one of the programs com- monly used. Berard’s auditory integration training con- sists of twenty half-hour sessions spent listening to musi- cal sounds via a stereophonic system. The music is ran- dom, with filtered frequencies, and the person listens through earphones. These sound waves vibrate and exer- cise structures in the middle ear. This is normally done in sessions twice a day for 10 days. | No

9205 | NarrativeText | Tomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It was his research that made the world aware that the ears of an infant in utero are already functioning at four and half months of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides nour- ishment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postulated that the sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutrient heard by the fetus. This sound literally charges and stimu- lates the growth of the brain. | No
9206 | NarrativeText | Tomatis took this further, into the realm of language. Tomatis concluded that the need to communicate and to be understood are among our most basic needs. He was a pioneer in perceiving that language problems convert into social problems for people. “Language is what character- izes man and makes him different from other creatures,” Tomatis is quoted as saying. The techniques he developed to teach people how to listen effectively are international- ly respected tools used in the treatment of autism, atten- tion-deficit disorder, and other learning disabilities. | No
9207 | NarrativeText | Internationally renowned French otolaryngologist, psychologist, educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis per- ceived the importance of sound and hearing early in his career. He took his degree as a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Paris and specialized in ear, nose and throat medicine. The son of two opera singers, Tomatis His listening program, the invention of the Electronic Ear, and his work with the therapeutic use of sound and music for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguably the best known and most successful ear specialist in the world. There are more than two hundred Tomatis Centers worldwide, treating a vast variety of problems related to the ability to hear. | No
9208 | NarrativeText | Alfred Tomatis is also the inventor of the Electronic Ear. This device operates through a series of filters, and reestablishes the dominance of the right ear in hearing. The basis of Tomatis’ work is a series of principles that follow: * Communication begins in the womb. As early as the beginning of the second trimester, fetuses can hear sounds. These sounds literally cause the brain and ner- vous system of the baby to develop. | No

9221 | NarrativeText | Certain audiological tests are carried out to see if the person has a CAP problem, and if so, how severe it is. Other tests give more specific information regarding the nature of the CAP problem. They include: ¢ Puretone air-conduction threshold testing, which mea- sures peripheral hearing loss. If loss is found, then bone-conduction testing, or evaluation of the vibration of small bones in the inner ear, is also carried out. | No
9222 | ListItem | Word discrimination scores (WDS) determines a per- son’s clarity in hearing ideal speech. This is done by presenting 25-50 words at 40 decibels above the per- son’s average sound threshold in each ear. Test scores equal the percentage of words heard correctly. | No

9224 | ListItem | Staggered sporadic word (SSW) testing delivers 40 compound words in an overlapping way at 50 decibels above threshold to each ear of the person being tested. This test provides expanded information that makes it possible to break down CAP problems into the four basic types. | No

9229 | Title | Research and general acceptance | No
9230 | NarrativeText | Auditory integration training is based upon newly learned information about the brain. Though brain struc- tures and connections are predetermined, probably by heredity, another factor called plasticity also comes into play. Learning, we now know, continues from birth to death. Plasticity is the ability of the brain to actually change its structuring and connections through the process of learning. | No
9231 | NarrativeText | Problems with auditory processing are now viewed as having a wide-reaching ripple effect on our society. It is estimated that 30-40% of children starting school have language-learning skills that can be described as poor. CAP difficulties are a factor in several different learning disabilities. They affect not only academic success, but also nearly every aspect of societal difficulties. One example to illustrate this is a 1989 University of Buffalo study where CAP problems were found to be present in a surprising 97% of youth inmates in an upstate New York corrections facility. | No

9247 | Title | Description | No
9248 | NarrativeText | Autism is a lifelong disorder that interferes with the ability to understand what is seen, heard, and touched. This can cause profound problems in personal behavior and in the ability to relate to others. A person with autism must learn how to communicate normally and how to relate to people, objects and events. However, not all patients suffer the same degree of impairment. There is a full spectrum of symptoms, which can range from mild to severe. | No
9249 | NarrativeText | Autism occurs in as many as one or two per 1,000 children. It is found four times more often in boys (usual- ly the first-born) and occurs around the world in all races and social backgrounds. Autism usually is evident in the first three years of life, although in some children it’s hard to tell when the problem develops. Sometimes the condition isn’t diagnosed until the child enters school. | No
9250 | NarrativeText | While a person with autism can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe, about 10% have an extraor- dinary ability in one area, such as in mathematics, mem- ory, music, or art. Such children are known as “autistic savants” (formerly known as “idiot savants.”). | No
9251 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9252 | NarrativeText | Autism is a brain disorder that affects the way the brain uses or transmits information. Studies have found abnormalities in several parts of the brain that almost certainly occurred during fetal development. The prob- lem may be centered in the parts of the brain responsible for processing language and information from the senses. | No
9253 | NarrativeText | There appears to be a strong genetic basis for autism. Identical twins are more likely to both be affected than twins who are fraternal (not genetically identical). In a family with one autistic child, the chance of having another child with autism is about | in 20, much higher than in the normal population. Sometimes, relatives of an autistic child have mild behaviors that look very much like autism, such as repetitive behaviors and social or communication prob- lems. Research also has found that some emotional dis- orders (such as manic depression) occur more often in families of a child with autism. | No
9254 | NarrativeText | At least one group of researchers has found a link between an abnormal gene and autism. The gene may be just one of at least three to five genes that interact in some way to cause the condition. Scientists suspect that a faulty gene or genes might make a person vulnerable to develop autism in the presence of other factors, such as a | No

9261 | NarrativeText | The severity of the condition varies between individ- uals, ranging from the most severe (extremely unusual, repetitive, self- injurious, and aggressive behavior) to very mild, resembling a personality disorder with some learning disability. | No
9262 | NarrativeText | Profound problems with social interaction are the most common symptoms of autism. Infants with the dis- order won’t cuddle; they avoid eye contact and don’t seem to want or need physical contact or affection. They may become rigid or flaccid when they are held, cry when picked up, and show little interest in human contact. Such a child doesn’t smile or lift his arms in anticipation of being picked up. He forms no attachment to parents nor shows any normal anxiety toward strangers. He doesn’t learn typical games of childhood, such as peek-a-boo. | No
9263 | Title | Language problems | No
9264 | NarrativeText | The child with autism may not speak at all; if he does, it is often in single words. He may endlessly repeat words or phrases that are addressed to him and may reverse pronouns (“You go sleep” instead of “I want to go to sleep”). | No
9265 | Title | Restricted interests and activity | No
9266 | NarrativeText | Usually a child with autism has many problems playing normally. He probably won’t act out adultroles during play time, and instead of enjoying fantasy play, he may simply repeatedly mimic the actions of someone else. Bizarre behavior patterns are very common among autistic children and may include complex rituals, screaming fits, rhythmic rocking, arm flapping, finger twiddling, and crying without tears. Autistic children may play with their own saliva, feces or urine. They may be self-destructive, biting their own hands, gouging at their eyes, pulling their hair, or banging their head. | No

Many of these children may react to sounds by banging their head or flapping fingers. Some high-functioning autistic adults who have written books about their childhood experi- ences report that sounds were often excruciatingly painful to them, forcing them to withdraw from their environment or try to cope by withdrawing into their own world of sensation and movement. | No
9270 | NarrativeText | Autism is diagnosed by observing the child’s behav- ior, communication skills, and social interactions. Med- ical tests should rule out other possible causes of autistic symptoms.

9275 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9276 | NarrativeText | There is no medical test for autism. Because the symptoms of autism are so varied, the condition may go undiagnosed for some time (especially in those with mild cases or if other handicaps are also present). It may be confused with other diseases, such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and untreated phenylketonuria. | No
9277 | ListItem | * preoccupation with parts of objects Some children have a few of the symptoms of autism, but not enough to be diagnosed with the “classical” form of the condition. Children who have autistic behavior but no problems with language may be diagnosed with “Asperger syndrome.” Children who seem normal at first but who begin to show autistic behavior as they get older might be diagnosed with “childhood disintegrative disor- der” (CDD). These problems are sometimes called “autis- tic spectrum disorders.” It is also important to rule out other problems that seem similar to autism. | No

9290 | NarrativeText | There is no cure for autism. Treatments are aimed at reducing specific symptoms. Because the symptoms vary so widely from one person to the next, there is not a sin- gle approach that works for every person.

However, a variety of drugs can control self-injurious, aggressive, and other of the more difficult behaviors. Drugs also can control epilepsy, which afflicts up to 20% of people with autism. | No
9294 | NarrativeText | Studies show that people with autism can improve significantly with proper treatment. A child with autism can learn best with special teachers in a structured pro- gram that emphasizes individual instruction. The two most-often studied types of treatment are: Five types of drugs are sometimes prescribed to help the behavior problems of people with autism: * stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) | No

9345 | NarrativeText | Autoimmune disorders are conditions in which a person’s immune system attacks the body’s own cells, causing tissue destruction. | No
9346 | Title | Description | No
9347 | NarrativeText | Autoimmunity is accepted as the cause of a wide range of disorders, and it is suspected to be responsible for many more. Autoimmune diseases are classified as either general, in which the autoimmune reaction takes place simultaneously in a number of tissues, or organ specific, in which the autoimmune reaction targets a single organ. | No
9348 | NarrativeText | Autoimmune disorders include the following: ¢ Systemic lupus erythematosus. A general autoim- mune disease in which antibodies attack a number of different tissues. The disease recurs periodically and is seen mainly in young and middle-aged women. | No
9349 | ListItem | Rheumatoid arthritis. Occurs when the immune sys- tem attacks and destroys the tissues that line bone joints and cartilage. The disease occurs throughout the body, although some joints may be more affected than others. | No
9350 | ListItem | Goodpasture’s syndrome. Occurs when antibodies are deposited in the membranes of both the lung and kid- neys, causing both inflammation of kidney glomerulus (glomerulonephritis) and lung bleeding. It is typically a disease of young males. | No
9351 | ListItem | Grave’s disease. Caused by an antibody that binds to specific cells in the thyroid gland, causing them to make excessive amounts of thyroid hormone. | No
9352 | ListItem | Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Caused by an antibody that binds to cells in the thyroid gland. Unlike in Grave’s disease, however, this antibody’s action results in less thyroid hormone being made. | No
9353 | ListItem | Pemphigus vulgaris. A group of autoimmune disorders that affect the skin. | No
9354 | ListItem | Myasthenia gravis. A condition in which the immune system attacks a receptor on the surface of muscle cells, preventing the muscle from receiving nerve impulses and resulting in severe muscle weakness. | No

9368 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9369 | NarrativeText | To further understand autoimmune disorders, it is helpful to understand the workings of the immune sys- tem. The purpose of the immune system is to defend the body against attack by infectious microbes (germs) and foreign objects. When the immune system attacks an invader, it is very specific—a particular immune system cell will only recognize and target one type of invader. To function properly, the immune system must not only develop this specialized knowledge of individual invaders, but it must also learn how to recognize and not destroy cells that belong to the body itself. Every cell carries protein markers on its surface that identifies it in one of two ways: what kind of cell it is (e.g. nerve cell, muscle cell, blood cell, etc.) and to whom that cell belongs. These markers are called major histocompata- bility complexes (MHCs). When functioning properly, cells of the immune system will not attack any other cell with markers identifying it as belonging to the body. Conversely, if the immune system cells do not recognize the cell as “self,” they attach themselves to it and put out a signal that the body has been invaded, which in turn stimulates the production of substances such as antibodies that engulf and destroy the foreign particles. In case of autoimmune disorders, the immune system cannot distinguish between “self” cells and invader cells. As a result, the same destructive operation is carried out on the body’s own cells that would nor- mally be carried out on bacteria, viruses, and other such harmful entities. | No
9370 | NarrativeText | The reasons why immune systems become dys- functional in this way is not well understood. However, most researchers agree that a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors play into autoim- munity. Researchers also speculate that certain mecha- nisms may trigger autoimmunity. First, a substance that is normally restricted to one part of the body, and there- fore not usually exposed to the immune system, is released into other areas where it is attacked. Second, the immune system may mistake a component of the body for a similar foreign component. Third, cells of the body may be altered in some way, either by drugs, infection, or some other environmental factor, so that they are no longer recognizable as “self” to the immune system. Fourth, the immune system itself may be dam- aged, such as by a genetic mutation, and therefore can- not function properly. | No
9371 | Title | Symptoms | No
9372 | NarrativeText | The symptoms of the above disorders include: ¢ Systemic lupus erythematosus. Symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, weight loss, skin rashes (particu- larly the classic “butterfly” rash on the face), vasculitis, polyarthralgia, patchy hair loss, sores in the mouth or nose, lymph-node enlargement, gastric problems, and, in women, irregular periods. About half of those who suffer from lupus develop cardiopulmonary problems, and some may also develop urinary problems. Lupus can also effect the central nervous system, causing seizures, depression, and psychosis. | No
9373 | ListItem | Rheumatoid arthritis. Initially may be characterized by a low-grade fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and a gener- alized pain in the joints. The joint pain then becomes more specific, usually beginning in the fingers, then spreading to other areas, such as the wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles. As the disease progresses, joint func- tion diminishes sharply and deformities occur, particular- ly the characteristic “swan’s neck” curling of the fingers. | No
9374 | ListItem | * Goodpasture’s syndrome. Symptoms are similar to that of iron deficiency anemia, including fatigue and pal- | No

9376 | ListItem | Grave’s disease. This disease is characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland, weight loss without loss of appetite, sweating, heart palpitations, nervousness, and an inability to tolerate heat. | No
9377 | ListItem | Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This disorder generally dis- plays no symptoms. | No
9378 | ListItem | Pemphigus vulgaris. This disease is characterized by blisters and deep lesions on the skin. | No
9379 | ListItem | Myasthenia gravis. Characterized by fatigue and mus- cle weakness that at first may be confined to certain muscle groups, but then may progress to the point of paralysis. Myasthenia gravis patients often have expres- sionless faces as well as difficulty chewing and swal- lowing. If the disease progresses to the respiratory sys- tem, artificial respiration may be required. | No
9380 | ListItem | Scleroderma. Disorder is usually preceded by Ray- naud’s phenomenon. Symptoms that follow include pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints, and the skin takes on a tight, shiny appearance. The digestive system also becomes involved, resulting in weight loss, appetite loss, diarrhea, constipation, and distention of the abdomen. As the disease progresses, the heart, lungs, and kidneys become involved, and malignant hyperten- sion causes death in approximately 30% of cases. | No
9381 | ListItem | Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. May be acute or chronic. Symptoms include fatigue and abdominal ten- derness due to an enlarged spleen. | No
9382 | ListItem | Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Characterized by pinhead-size red dots on the skin, unexplained bruises, bleeding from the nose and gums, and blood in the stool. | No
9383 | ListItem | Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. In polymyositis, symptoms include muscle weakness, particularly in the shoulders or pelvis, that prevents the patient from per- forming everyday activities. In dermatomyositis, the same muscle weakness is accompanied by a rash that appears on the upper body, arms, and fingertips. A rash may also appear on the eyelids, and the area around the eyes may become swollen. | No
9384 | ListItem | Pernicious anemia. Signs of pernicious anemia include weakness, sore tongue, bleeding gums, and tingling in the extremities. Because the disease caus- es a decrease in stomach acid, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and constipation are possible. Also, because Vitamin B,, is essential for the nervous system function, the deficiency of it brought on by the disease can result in a host of neu- | No

9387 | ListItem | Sjogren’s syndrome. Characterized by excessive dry- ness of the mouth and eyes. | No
9388 | ListItem | Ankylosing spondylitis. Generally begins with lower back pain that progresses up the spine. The pain may eventually become crippling. | No
9389 | ListItem | Vasculitis. Symptoms depend upon the group of veins affected and can range greatly. | No
9390 | ListItem | Type I diabetes mellitus. Characterized by fatigue and an abnormally high level of glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia). | No
9391 | ListItem | Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. First signs are stum- bling and difficulty climbing stairs. Later, muscle cramps and twitching may be observed as well as weakness in the hands making fastening buttons or turning a key difficult. Speech may become slowed or slurred. There may also be difficluty swallowing. As respiratory muscles atrophy, there is increased danger of aspiration or lung infection. | No
9392 | ListItem | Guillain-Barre syndrome. Muscle weakness in the legs occurs first, then the arms and face. Paresthesias (a prickly, tingling sensation) is also felt. This disorder affects both sides of the body and may involve paralysis and the muscles that control breathing. | No
9393 | ListItem | Multiple sclerosis. Like Lou Gehrig’s disease, the first symptom may be clumsiness. Weakness or exhaustion is often reported, as well as blurry or double vision. There may be dizziness, depression, loss of bladder control, and muscle weakness so severe that the patient is confined to a wheelchair. | No
9394 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9395 | NarrativeText | A number of tests are involved in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, depending on the particular dis- ease; e.g. blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, elec- tromylogram (measures muscle function), and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Usually, these tests determine the location and extent of damage or involve- ment. They are useful in charting progress of the disease and as baselines for treatment. | No
9396 | NarrativeText | The principle tool, however, for authenticating autoimmune disease is antibody testing. Such tests involve measuring the level of antibodies found in the blood and determining if they react with specific anti- gens that would give rise to an autoimmune reaction. An elevated amount of antibodies indicates that a humoral immune reaction is occurring. Since elevated antibody | No
9397 | Title | 424 | No
9398 | NarrativeText | levels are also seen in common infections, they must be ruled out as the cause for the increased antibody levels. | No
9399 | NarrativeText | Antibodies can also be typed by class. There are five classes of antibodies, and they can be separated in the laboratory. The class IgG is usually associated with autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, IgG class antibod- ies are also the main class of antibody seen in normal immune responses. | No
9400 | NarrativeText | The most useful antibody tests involve introducing the patient’s antibodies to samples of his or her own tis- sue, usually thyroid, stomach, liver, and kidney tissue. If antibodies bind to the “self” tissue, it is diagnostic for an autoimmune disorder. Antibodies from a person without an autoimmune disorder would not react to “self” tissue. | No
9401 | Title | Treatment | No
9402 | NarrativeText | Treatment of autoimmune diseases is specific to the disease, and usually concentrates on alleviating or preventing symptoms rather than correcting the under- lying cause. For example, if a gland involved in an autoimmune reaction is not producing a hormone such as insulin, administration of that hormone is required. Administration of a hormone, however, will restore the function of the gland damaged by the autoimmune disease. | No
9403 | NarrativeText | The other aspect of treatment is controlling the inflammatory and proliferative nature of the immune response. This is generally accomplished with two types of drugs. Steroid compounds are used to control inflam- mation. There are many different steroids, each having side effects. The proliferative nature of the immune response is controlled with immunosuppressive drugs. These drugs work by inhibiting the replication of cells and, therefore, also suppress non-immune cells leading to side effects such as anemia. | No
9404 | NarrativeText | Systemic enzyme therapy is a new treatment that is showing results for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclero- sis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory dis- eases. Enzymes combinations of pancreatin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, bromelain, and papain help stimulate the body’s own defenses, accelerate inflammation in order to reduce swelling and improve circulation, and break up the immune complexes within the bloodstream. Symp- toms have been reduced using this treatment. | No
9405 | NarrativeText | Other treatments that hold some promise are irradia- tion of the spleen and gene therapy. Splenic irradiation is touted to be a safe, alternative for patients with autoim- mune blood diseases, especially autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or others with compromised immune systems, such as HIV patients and the elderly. It is reported to have few side effects and seems to be working. Cytokine | No

9413 | NarrativeText | Most autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented. Though the mechanisms involved in how these diseases affect the body are known, it is still unclear why the body turns on itself. Since more women than men seem to be affected by some of these disorders (e.g. lupus), some researchers are looking into hormones as a factor. This, and gene therapy, may be the preventatives of the future. | No

9431 | NarrativeText | An autopsy is a postmortem assessment or examina- tion of a body to determine the cause of death. An autop- sy is performed by a physician trained in pathology. | No
9432 | Title | Purpose | No
9433 | NarrativeText | Most autopsies advance medical knowledge and provide evidence for legal action. Medically, autopsies determine the exact cause and circumstances of death, discover the pathway of a disease, and provide valuable information to be used in the care of the living. When foul play is suspected, a government coroner or medical examiner performs autopsies for legal use. This branch of medical study is called forensic medicine. Forensic specialists investigate deaths resulting from violence or occurring under suspicious circumstances. | No
9434 | NarrativeText | Benefits of research from autopsies include the pro- duction of new medical information on diseases such as toxic shock syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Organ donation, which can potential- ly save the lives of other patients, is also another benefit of autopsies. | No
9435 | Title | Precautions | No
9436 | NarrativeText | When performed for medical reasons, autopsies require formal permission from family members or the legal guardian. (Autopsies required for legal reasons when foul play is suspected do not need the consent of next of kin.) During the autopsy, very concise notes and documentation must be made for both medical and legal reasons. Some religious groups prohibit autopsies. | No

9444 | Title | Description | No
9445 | NarrativeText | An autopsy can be described as the examination of a deceased human body with a detailed exam of the per- son’s remains. This procedure dates back to the Roman era when few human dissections were performed; autop- sies were utilized, however, to determine the cause of death in criminal cases. At the beginning of the proce- dure the exterior body is examined and then the internal organs are removed and studied. Some pathologists argue that more autopsies are performed than necessary. However, recent studies show that autopsies can detect major findings about a person’s condition that were not suspected when the person was alive. And the growing awareness of the influence of genetic factors in disease has also emphasized the importance of autopsies. | No
9446 | NarrativeText | Despite the usefulness of autopsies, fewer autopsies have been performed in the United States during the past | No
9447 | Title | 426 | No
9448 | NarrativeText | 10-20 years. A possible reason for this decline is concern about malpractice suits on the part of the treating physi- cian. Other possible reasons are that hospitals are per- forming fewer autopsies because of the expense or because modern technology, such as CT scans and mag- netic resonance imaging, can often provide sufficient diagnostic information. Nonetheless, federal regulators and pathology groups have begun to establish new guide- lines designed to increase the number and quality of autopsies being performed. | No
9449 | NarrativeText | Many experts are concerned that if the number of autopsies increases, hospitals may be forced to charge families a fee for the procedure as autopies are not nor- mally covered by insurance companies or Medicare. Yet, according to several pathologists, the benefit of the pro- cedure for families and doctors does justify the cost. In medical autopsies, physicians remain cautious to exam- ine only as much of the body as permitted according to the wishes of the family. It is important to note that autopsies can also provide peace of mind for the bereaved family in certain situations. | No

9470 | NarrativeText | Also known as aerospace medicine, flight medicine, or space medicine, aviation medicine is a medical spe- cialty that focuses on the physical and psychological conditions associated with flying and space travel. | No
9471 | Title | Purpose | No
9472 | NarrativeText | Since flying airplanes and spacecraft involves great risk and physical demands, such as changes in gravity and oxygen, pilots and astronauts need medical experts to protect their safety and the public’s safety. | No
9473 | Title | Description | No
9474 | Title | Pressure changes | No
9475 | NarrativeText | In the United States, the Federal Aviation Adminis- tration (FAA) requires all pilots who fly above 14,500 ft (4,420 m) to be prepared for pressure changes caused by lower oxygen levels at high altitude. Pilots must either have a pressurized cabin or access to an oxygen mask. Without these protections, they could experience hypox- ia, or altitude sickness. Hypoxia reduces the amount of oxygen in the brain, causing such symptoms as dizziness, shortness of breath, and mental confusion. These symptoms could cause the pilot to lose control of the plane. Hypoxia can be treated with oxygen therapy. | No
9476 | NarrativeText | Rapid altitude increases and decreases can cause pain because there is an air pocket in the middle portion of the ear. To equalize pressure in the ear, physicians typ- ically advise pilots and passengers to clear their sinuses by plugging their nose and blowing until the eardrums “pop.” Other options include yawning, swallowing or chewing gum. For people with a cold or a severely blocked middle ear, the use of decongestants, antihista- mines, or nasal sprays may help. Without taking steps to equalize pressure, the tympanic membrane could rupture, causing hearing loss, vertigo, dizziness, and nausea. | No
9477 | Title | Gravity’s impact | No
9478 | NarrativeText | Fighter pilots who fly high-performance jets can experience health problems during rapid acceleration and when executing tight turns at high speed. During these moves, a pilot experiences extreme gravity conditions that can pull blood away from the brain and heart and into the lower body. This can cause the pilot to have tun- nel vision or pass out. To prevent these potentially deadly situations, the military requires fighter pilots to wear spe- cial flight suits, or G suits, which have compartments that fill with air or fluid to keep blood from pooling in the lower body. | No
9479 | NarrativeText | Some pilots, like the Blue Angels, use a technique called the Valsalva Maneuver instead of G suits to pre- vent black outs during high-performance flying. The Val- salva Maneuver involves grunting and tightening the abdominal muscles to stop blood from collecting in the wrong parts of the body. | No
9480 | NarrativeText | PREVENTIVE CARE. Since any routine health problem that affects a pilot could mean the loss of hundreds of lives, aviation medicine specialists who work for com- mercial airlines and the military take special care to edu- cate pilots about proper diet, exercise and preventive health tools. For example, physicians may frequently screen pilots for vision changes caused by glaucoma or cataracts. They also will check for hearing loss and encourage the pilot to wear earplugs or headphones to buffer engine noise. To monitor for heart disease, physi- cians will check blood pressure and may order diagnostic tests such as an ECG or stress test. | No
9481 | Title | Motion sickness | No
9482 | NarrativeText | Many people experience nausea, vertigo, and disori- entation when they first arrive in space. This is caused by changes in the fluid in the inner ear, which is sensitive to gravity and affects our sense of spatial orientation. The symptoms typically ease after several days, but often recur when the astronaut returns to Earth. To treat this condition, physicians give astronauts motion sickness medication, such as lorazepam. | No

Exercise is an important treatment. Crew members may use an exercise cycle or resistive rubber bands to stay in shape. Physicians also may give them medication to prevent bone loss and prescribe nutritional supplements, such as a mixture of essential amino acids and carbohydrates, to limit muscle atrophy. | No
9491 | Title | Radiation | No
9492 | NarrativeText | Another health threat to space travelers is radiation. Harmful rays can alter the DNA in human cells and cause cancer. Excess radiation also can weaken the immune system. To prevent these problems, physicians may give astronauts nutritional supplements. For exam- ple, research has show that n-3 fatty acids found in fish oil reduce DNA damage. | No
9493 | Title | Cardiovascular issues | No
9494 | NarrativeText | When astronauts return to earth after a long mission, they tend to feel dizzy and black out. Scientists are con- cerned about this dilemma because it could be dangerous if the crew members need to make an emergency exit. One way to prevent this problem, which is caused by a drop in blood pressure, is to have the astronauts drink extra fluids and increase salt intake to increase blood vol- ume. Physicians also may prescribe medication that causes blood vessels to contract. As another precaution, astronauts also put on protective flight suits, or G suits, before they re-enter the earth’s atmosphere. | No

9512 | NarrativeText | Ayurvedic medicine is a system of healing that originated in ancient India. In Sanskrit, ayur means life or living, and veda means knowledge, so Ayurveda has been defined as the “knowledge of living” or the “science of longevity.” Ayurvedic medicine utilizes diet, detoxification and purification techniques, herbal and mineral remedies, yoga, breathing exercis- es, meditation, and massage therapy as holistic heal- ing methods. Ayurvedic medicine is widely practiced in modern India and has been steadily gaining follow- ers in the West. | No

9515 | NarrativeText | Deepak Chopra was born in India and studied medi- cine at the All India Institute of Medical Science. He left his home for the United States in 1970 and completed residencies in internal medicine and endocrinology. He went on to teaching posts at major medical institutions— | No

9517 | NarrativeText | Disturbed by Western medicine’s reliance on med- ication, he began a search for alternatives and discovered one in the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an Indian spiritualist who had gained a cult following in the late sixties teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM). Chopra began practicing TM fervently and eventually met the Maharishi. In 1985 Chopra established the Ayurvedic Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine in Lancaster, Massachusetts, where he began his practice of integrating the best aspects of Eastern and Western medicine. | No
9518 | NarrativeText | In 1993, he published Creating Affluence: Wealth Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities, and the enormously successful best seller, Ageless Body, Timeless Mind. In the latter he presents his most radical thesis: that aging is not the inevitable deterioration of organs and mind that we have been traditionally taught to think of it as. It is a process that can be influenced, slowed down, and even reversed with the correct kinds of therapies, almost all of which are self-administered or self-taught. He teaches that applying a regimen of nutritional bal- ance, meditation, and emotional clarity characterized by such factors as learning to easily and quickly express anger, for instance, can lead to increased lifespans of up to 120 years. | No
9519 | Title | Purpose | No
9520 | NarrativeText | According to the original texts, the goal of Ayurveda is prevention as well as promotion of the body’s own capacity for maintenance and balance. Ayurvedic treat- ment is non-invasive and non-toxic, so it can be used safely as an alternative therapy or alongside conventional therapies. Ayurvedic physicians claim that their methods can also help stress-related, metabolic, and chronic con- ditions. Ayurveda has been used to treat acne, allergies, asthma, anxiety, arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, colds, colitis, constipation, depression, diabetes, flu, heart disease, hypertension, immune problems, inflam- mation, insomnia, nervous disorders, obesity, skin prob- Jems, and ulcers. | No
9521 | NarrativeText | Ayurvedic physicians seek to discover the roots of a disease before it gets so advanced that more radical treat- ments are necessary. Thus, Ayurveda seems to be limited in treating severely advanced conditions, traumatic injuries, acute pain, and conditions and injuries requiring invasive surgery. Ayurvedic techniques have also been used alongside chemotherapy and surgery to assist patients in recovery and healing. | No

9523 | Title | Origins | No
9524 | NarrativeText | Ayurvedic medicine originated in the early civiliza- tions of India some 3,000-5,000 years ago. It is men- tioned in the Vedas, the ancient religious and philosophi- cal texts that are the oldest surviving literature in the world, which makes Ayurvedic medicine the oldest sur- viving healing system. According to the texts, Ayurveda was conceived by enlightened wise men as a system of living harmoniously and maintaining the body so that mental and spiritual awareness could be possible. Med- ical historians believe that Ayurvedic ideas were trans- ported from ancient India to China and were instrumental in the development of Chinese medicine. | No

Aided by the efforts of Deepak Chopra and the Maharishi, it has become an increasingly accepted alternative medical treatment in America during the last two decades. Chopra is an M.D. who has written several bestsellers based on Ayurvedic ideas. He also helped develop the Center for Mind/Body Medicine in La Jolla, California, a major Ayurvedic center that trains physicians in Ayurvedic principles, produces herbal remedies, and conducts research and documentation of its healing techniques. | No
9527 | NarrativeText | The vata dosha is associated with air and ether, and in the body promotes movement and lightness. Vata peo- ple are generally thin and light physically, dry-skinned, and very energetic and mentally restless. When vata is out of balance, there are often nervous problems, hyper- activity, sleeplessness, lower back pains, and headaches. | No
9528 | NarrativeText | Pitta is associated with fire and water. In the body, it is responsible for metabolism and digestion. Pitta char- acteristics are medium-built bodies, fair skin, strong digestion, and good mental concentration. Pitta imbal- ances show up as anger and aggression and stress-relat- ed conditions like gastritis, ulcers, liver problems, and hypertension. | No
9529 | Title | Key ideas | No
9530 | NarrativeText | To understand Ayurvedic treatment, it is necessary to have an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the body. The basic life force in the body is prana, which is also found in the elements and is similar to the Chinese notion of chi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi and expert, put it, “Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen, nor any of its chemical constituents. It is in food, water, and in the sunlight, yet it is not vitamin, heat, or light- rays. Food, water, air, etc., are only the media through which the prana is carried.” | No
9531 | NarrativeText | In Ayurveda, there are five basic elements that con- tain prana: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These ele- ments interact and are further organized in the human body as three main categories or basic physiological principles in the body that govern all bodily functions known as the doshas. The three doshas are vata, pitta, and kapha. Each person has a unique blend of the three doshas, known as the person’s prakriti, which is why Ayurvedic treatment is always individualized. In Ayurveda, disease is viewed as a state of imbalance in one or more of a person’s doshas, and an Ayurvedic physician strives to adjust and balance them, using a variety of techniques. | No
9532 | NarrativeText | The kapha dosha is associated with water and earth. People characterized as kapha are generally large or heavy with more oily complexions. They tend to be slow, calm, and peaceful. Kapha disorders manifest emotional- ly as greed and possessiveness, and physically as obesity, fatigue, bronchitis, and sinus problems. | No
9533 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9534 | NarrativeText | In Ayurvedic medicine, disease is always seen as an imbalance in the dosha system, so the diagnostic process strives to determine which doshas are underactive or overactive in a body. Diagnosis is often taken over a course of days in order for the Ayurvedic physician to most accurately determine what parts of the body are being affected. To diagnose problems, Ayurvedic physi- cians often use long questionnaires and interviews to determine a person’s dosha patterns and physical and psychological histories. Ayurvedic physicians also intri- cately observe the pulse, tongue, face, lips, eyes, and fin- gernails for abnormalities or patterns that they believe can indicate deeper problems in the internal systems. Some Ayurvedic physicians also use laboratory tests to assist in diagnosis. | No
9535 | Title | 430 | No
9536 | Title | Treatment | No
9537 | NarrativeText | Ayurvedic treatment seeks to re-establish balance and harmony in the body’s systems. Usually the first method of treatment involves some sort of detoxification and cleansing of the body, in the belief that accumulated toxins must be removed before any other methods of treatment will be effective. Methods of detoxification include therapeutic vomiting, laxatives, medicated ene- mas, fasting, and cleansing of the sinuses. Many Ayur- vedic clinics combine all of these cleansing methods into intensive sessions known as panchakarma. Panchakarma can take several days or even weeks and they are more than elimination therapies. They also include herbalized oil massage and herbalized heat treatments. After purifi- cation, Ayurvedic physicians use herbal and mineral remedies to balance the body as well. Ayurvedic medicine contains a vast knowledge of the use of herbs for specific health problems. | No
9538 | NarrativeText | Ayurvedic medicine also emphasizes how people live their lives from day to day, believing that proper lifestyles and routines accentuate balance, rest, diet, and preven- tion. Ayurveda recommends yoga as a form of exercise to build strength and health, and also advises massage thera- py and self-massage as ways of increasing circulation and reducing stress. Yogic breathing techniques and medita- tion are also part of a healthy Ayurvedic regimen, to reduce stress and improve mental energy. | No
9539 | NarrativeText | Of all treatments, though, diet is one of the most basic and widely used therapy in the Ayurvedic system. An Ayurvedic diet can be a very well planned and indi- vidualized regimen. According to Ayurveda, there are six basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astrin- gent. Certain tastes and foods can either calm or aggra- vate a particular dosha. For instance, sweet, sour, and salty decrease vata problems and increase kapha. Sour, salty, and pungent can increase pitta. After an Ayurvedic physician determines a person’s dosha profile, they will recommend a specific diet to correct imbalances and increase health. The Ayurvedic diet emphasizes primarily vegetarian foods of high quality and freshness, tailored to the season and time of day. Cooling foods are eaten in the summer and heating ones in the winter, always within a person’s dosha requirements. In daily routine, the heav- iest meal of the day should be lunch, and dinner should eaten well before bedtime, to allow for complete diges- tion. Also, eating meals in a calm manner with proper chewing and state of mind is important, as is combining foods properly and avoiding overeating. | No

9555 | NarrativeText | Because Ayurveda had been outside the Western sci- entific system for years, research in the United States is new. Another difficulty in documentation arises because Ayurvedic treatment is very individualized; two people with the same disease but different dosha patterns might be treated differently. Much more scientific research has been conducted over the past several decades in India. Much research in the United States is being supported by the Maharishi Ayur-Ved organization, which studies the Ayurvedic products it sells and its clinical practices. | No
9556 | NarrativeText | Some Ayurvedic herbal mixtures have been proven to have high antioxidant properties, much stronger than vita- mins A, C, and E, and some have also been shown in labo- ratory tests to reduce or eliminate tumors in mice and to inhibit cancer growth in human lung tumor cells. In a 1987 study at MIT, an Ayurvedic herbal remedy was shown to significantly reduce colon cancer in rats. Anoth- er study was performed in the Netherlands with Maharishi Ayur-Ved products. A group of patients with chronic ill- nesses, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, hyperten- sion, eczema, psoriasis, constipation, rheumatoid arthri- tis, headaches, and non-insulin dependent diabetes melli- tus, were given Ayurvedic treatment. Strong results were observed, with nearly 80% of the patients improving and some chronic conditions being completely cured. | No
9557 | NarrativeText | Other studies have shown that Ayurvedic therapies can significantly lower cholesterol and blood pressure in stress-related problems. Diabetes, acne, and allergies have also been successfully treated with Ayurvedic reme- dies. Ayurvedic products have been shown to increase short-term memory and reduce headaches. Also, Ayurvedic remedies have been used successfully to sup- port the healing process of patients undergoing chemotherapy, as these remedies have been demonstrated to increase immune system activity. | No

9582 | Title | Description | No
9583 | NarrativeText | Babesiosis is a rare, tick-transmitted disease that is caused most often by the single-celled parasite Babesia microti. By 1995, fewer than 500 cases of babesiosis had been reported in the United States. The disease occurs primarily in New England and New York, especially on the coastal islands. However, cases have occurred in other parts of the United States. Because of tick activity, the risk for babesiosis is highest during June and July. | No
9584 | NarrativeText | Ticks are small, blood-sucking arachnids. Although some ticks carry disease-causing organisms, most do not. Babesia microti is spread to humans through the bite of the tick Ixodes scapularis (also called Ixodes dammini). Ixodes scapularis, called the “blacklegged deer tick,” usu- ally feeds on deer and mice. A tick picks up the parasites by feeding on an infected mouse and then passes them on by biting a new host, possibly a human. To pass on the parasites, the tick must be attached to the skin for 36-48 hours. Once in the bloodstream, Babesia microti enters a red blood cell, reproduces by cell division, and destroys the cell. Humans infected with Babesia microti produce antibodies that can be helpful in diagnosing the infection. | No
9585 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9586 | NarrativeText | Babesia microti live and divide within red blood cells, destroying the cells and causing anemia. The majority of people who are infected have no visible symptoms. In those who become ill, symptoms appear one to six weeks following the tick bite. Because the ticks are small, many patients have no recollection of a tick bite. The symptoms are flu-like and include tired- ness, loss of appetite, fever, drenching sweats, and mus- cle pain. Nausea, vomiting, headache, shaking chills, blood in the urine, and depression can occur. | No
9587 | NarrativeText | Persons who are over 40 years old, have had their spleen removed (splenectomized), and/or have a serious disease (cancer, AIDS, etc.) are at a greater risk for severe babesiosis. In severe cases of babesiosis, up to 85% of the blood cells can be infected. This causes a serious, possibly fatal, blood deficiency. | No
9588 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9589 | NarrativeText | Babesiosis can be diagnosed by examining a blood sample microscopically and detecting the presence of Babesia microti within the blood cells. The blood can also be checked for the presence of antibodies to the parasite. | No
9590 | Title | Treatment | No
9591 | NarrativeText | In serious cases, babesiosis is treated with a combi- nation of clindamycin (Cleocin) and quinine. Clin- damycin is given by injection and quinine is given orally three to four times a day for four to seven days. To reduce the number of parasites in the blood, severely ill patients have been treated with blood transfusions. | No

9616 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9617 | NarrativeText | Scientists have recently isolated two varieties of the Bartonella bacteria as the cause of bacillary angiomato- sis: Bartonella (formerly Rochalimaeaquintana) and B. henselae (cause of cat-scratch disease). | No
9618 | NarrativeText | B. quintana infection is known popularly as trench fever, and is the infection associated with body lice that sickened European troops during World War I. Lice carry the bacteria, and can transmit the infection to humans. The incidence of trench fever was believed to have faded away with the end of World War I. It was not diagnosed in the United States until 1992, when 10 cases were reported among homeless Seattle men. | No
9619 | NarrativeText | The related bacteria B. henselae was first identified several years ago as the cause of cat-scratch fever. It also can lead to bacillary angiomatosis in AIDS patients. Bacillary angiomatosis caused by this bacteria is trans- mitted to AIDS patients from cat fleas. | No
9620 | NarrativeText | These two different types of bacteria both cause bacillary angiomatosis, a disease which is characterized by wildly proliferating blood vessels that form tumor-like masses in the skin and organs. The nodules that appear in bacillary angiomatosis are firm and don’t turn white when pressed. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, in numbers ranging from one to 100. They are rarely found on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or in the mouth. As the number of lesions increase, the patient may devel- op a high fever, sweats, chills, poor appetite, vomiting, and weight loss. If untreated, infection may be fatal. | No
9621 | NarrativeText | In addition to the basic disease process, the two dif- ferent types of bacteria cause some slightly different symptoms. Patients infected with B. henselae also expe- rience blood-filled cysts within the liver and abnormal liver function, whereas B. quintana patients may have tumor growths in the bone. | No
9622 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9623 | NarrativeText | This life-threatening but curable infection is often misdiagnosed, because it may be mistaken for other con- ditions (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma).

9642 | Title | Description | No
9643 | NarrativeText | Bacteremia occurs when bacteria enter the blood- stream. This may occur through a wound or infection, or through a surgical procedure or injection. Bacteremia may cause no symptoms and resolve without treatment, or it may produce fever and other symptoms of infection. In some cases, bacteremia leads to septic shock, a poten- tially life-threatening condition. | No
9644 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9645 | Title | Causes | No
9646 | NarrativeText | Several types of bacteria live on the surface of the skin or colonize the moist linings of the urinary tract, lower digestive tract, and other internal surfaces. These bacteria are normally harmless as long as they are kept in check by the body’s natural barriers and the immune sys- tem. People in good health with strong immune systems rarely develop bacteremia. However, when bacteria are introduced directly into the circulatory system, especial- ly in a person who is ill or undergoing aggressive med- ical treatment, the immune system may not be able to cope with the invasion, and symptoms of bacteremia may develop. For this reason, bacteremia is most common in people who are already affected by or being treated for some other medical problem. In addition, medical treat- ment may bring a person in contact with new types of bacteria that are more invasive than those already resid- ing in that person’s body, further increasing the likeli- hood of bacterial infection. | No

9691 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9692 | NarrativeText | Bad breath can be caused by a number of problems. Oral diseases, fermentation of food particles in the mouth, sinus infections, and unclean dentures can all contribute to mouth odor. Many non-oral diseases, such as lung infections, kidney failure, or severe liver disease, can also cause bad breath, though rarely. Many people think that bad breath can originate in the stomach or intestines; this is extremely rare. The esophagus is usual- ly collapsed and closed, and, although a belch may carry odor up from the stomach, the chance of bad breath being caused from air continually escaping from the stomach is remote. Cigarette smoke can cause bad breath, not only in the cigarette smoker, but also in one who is constantly exposed to second-hand smoke. | No
9693 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9694 | NarrativeText | The easiest way to determine if one has bad breath is to ask someone who is trustworthy and discrete. This is usually not too difficult. Another, more private, method of determining if one has bad breath is to lick one’s wrist, wait until it dries, then smell the area. Scraping the rear area of the tongue with a plastic spoon, then smelling the spoon, is another method one can use to assess bad breath. | No

Gentle brushing of the tongue should be part of daily oral hygiene. In addition to good oral hygiene, the judicious use of mouthwashes is helpful. Mouth dryness, experi- enced at night or during fasting, or due to certain med- ications and medical conditions, can contribute to bad breath. Dryness can be avoided by drinking adequate amounts of water. Chewing gum may be beneficial. | No
9699 | NarrativeText | As mentioned, some medications, such as some high blood pressure medications, can cause dry mouth. If this problem is significant, a medication change, under the supervision of one’s health care provider, may improve the dry-mouth condition.

9716 | NarrativeText | Balance is the ability to maintain a position. Coordi- nation is the capacity to move through a complex set of movements. Balance and coordination depend on the interaction of multiple body organs and systems includ- ing the eyes, ears, brain and nervous system, cardiovas- cular system, and muscles. Tests or examination of any or all of these organs or systems may be necessary to determine the causes of loss of balance, dizziness, or the inability to coordinate movement or activities. | No
9717 | Title | Purpose | No

9720 | NarrativeText | Tests for balance and coordination should be con- ducted in a safe and controlled area where patients will not experience injury if they become dizzy or fall. | No
9721 | Title | Description | No
9722 | NarrativeText | Assessment of balance and coordination can include discussion of the patient’s medical history and a com- plete physical examination including evaluation of the heart, head, eyes, and ears. A slow pulse or heart rate, or very low blood pressure may indicate a circulatory sys- tem problem, which can cause dizziness or fainting. Dur- ing the examination, the patient may be asked to rotate the head from side to side while sitting up or while lying down with the head and neck extended over the edge of the examination table. If these tests produce dizziness or a rapid twitching of the eyeballs (nystagmus), the patient may have a disorder of the inner ear, which is responsible for maintaining balance. | No
9723 | NarrativeText | An examination of the eyes and ears may also give clues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination.

The patient may be asked to squeeze or push against the doctor’s hands, to squat down, to bend over, stand on tiptoes or stand on their heels. Important aspects of these tests include holding positions for a certain num- ber of seconds, successfully repeating movements a certain number of times, and repeating the test accu- rately with eyes closed.

9755 | NarrativeText | Balanitis is an inflammation of the head and fore- skin of the penis. | No
9756 | Title | Description | No
9757 | NarrativeText | Balanitis generally affects uncircumcised males. These are men who have a foreskin, which is the “hood” of soft skin that partially covers the head of the penis. In balanitis, the head and foreskin become red and inflamed. (In circum- cised men, who lack a foreskin, these symptoms only affect the tip of the penis.) The condition often occurs due to the fungus Candida albicans, the same organism that causes vaginal yeast infections in women. Balanitis (which is also referred to as balanoposthitis) can be caused by a variety of other fungal or bacterial infections, or may occur due to a sensitivity reaction to common chemical agents. | No
9758 | NarrativeText | Uncircumcised men are more at risk for balanitis due to the presence of the foreskin. The snug fit of the foreskin around the top of the penis tends to create a damp, warm environment that encourages the growth of microorganisms. Most of the organisms associated with balanitis are already present on the penis, but in very small numbers. However, if the area between the head and foreskin is not cleansed thoroughly on a regular basis, these organisms can multiply and lead to infection. | No
9759 | NarrativeText | Diabetes can increase the risk of developing the con- dition. | No
9760 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9761 | NarrativeText | Balanitis is usually a result of poor hygiene—for example, neglecting to bathe for several days. A failure to properly wash (or rinse) the area between the head and foreskin can lead to the development of fungal or bacteri- al infections that cause the condition. In other cases, bal- anitis may occur due to an allergic reaction: Some men may be sensitive to chemicals found in harsh soaps, laun- dry detergents, or contraceptive creams. Men who con- tract a sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as trichimoniasis may also develop symptoms. | No
9762 | NarrativeText | The symptoms of balanitis are limited to the fore- skin and head of the penis (in circumcised men, only the head is affected). These include redness, inflammation, pain, discharge, sore or itchy skin, and difficulty retract- ing the foreskin. | No
9763 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9764 | NarrativeText | Balanitis is usually diagnosed based on a brief physi- cal examination. This may be conducted by your regular health care provider or by a urologist, the type of doctor who specializes in such disorders. The doctor may take a sample of the discharge (if any) to determine the nature of the possible infection. A urine test may be recommended to evaluate glucose (sugar) levels in the urine. Balanitis treatment is typically covered by medical insurance. | No
9765 | Title | Treatment | No
9766 | NarrativeText | The treatment of balanitis depends on the specific cause, which can vary from case to case. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, while topical antifun- gals such as clotrimazole can combat balanitis caused by Candida. If an allergic reaction is causing symptoms, the goal is to identify the chemical agent responsible. Oint- ments or creams may be used to ease skin irritation. | No
9767 | NarrativeText | No matter what the cause, it is important to thor- oughly clean the penis on a daily basis in order to allevi- ate symptoms. If the condition keeps occurring, or if the inflammation is interfering with urination, circumcision may be advised. | No
9768 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
9769 | NarrativeText | According to practitioners of alternative medicine, certain herbs may be effective in controlling or prevent- ing yeast infections—a common cause of balanitis. These remedies include garlic, calendula, and gold- enseal. Eating yogurt that contains acidophilus may also help to clear up a Candida infection. | No
9770 | Title | Prognosis | No
9771 | NarrativeText | Most cases go away quickly once the cause is identi- fied and treated. However, regular bouts of balanitis can result in urethral stricture. | No

9791 | NarrativeText | Balantidiasis is an infectious disease produced by a single-celled microorganism (protozoan) called Balan- tidium coli that infects the digestive tract. It is primarily a disease of the tropics, although it is also found in cooler, temperate climates. Most persons with balantidiasis do not exhibit any noticeable symptoms (asymptomatic), but a few individuals will develop diarrhea with blood and mucus and an inflamed colon (colitis). | No
9792 | Title | Description | No
9793 | NarrativeText | Balantidiasis is caused by Balantidium coli, a para- sitic protozoan that infects the large intestine. B. coli is the largest and only protozoan, having cilia or hair-like structures, that is capable of causing disease in humans. Balantidiasis occurs most commonly in areas with poor sanitation and in settings where humans live in close contact with pigs, sheep, or goats. | No
9794 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
9795 | NarrativeText | Balantidiasis is transmitted primarily by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated by human or animal feces containing B. coli cysts. During its life cycle, this organism exists in two very different forms: the infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move but can survive outside the human body because of its thick, protective covering; and the disease-producing form, the trophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot infect others. In the digestive tract, the cysts are transport- ed to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile tropho- zoites. Once released within the intestine, the tropho- zoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the large intestine. Within the lining of the large intestine, the trophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores (ulcers) or abscesses. Trophozoites eventually form new cysts that are carried through the digestive tract and excreted in the feces. Under favorable temperature and humidity condi- tions, the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks to months, ready to begin the cycle again. | No
9796 | NarrativeText | Most individuals with balantidiasis have no notice- able symptoms. Even though these individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable of infecting others by per- son-to-person contact or by contaminating food or water with cysts that others may ingest, for example, by prepar- ing food with unwashed hands. | No
9797 | NarrativeText | The most common symptoms of balantidiasis are chronic diarrhea or severe colitis with abdominal cramps, pain, and bloody stools. Complications may include intestinal perforation in which the intestinal wall becomes torn, but the organisms do not spread to other parts of the body in the blood stream. | No
9798 | Title | Diagnosis | No
9799 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of balantidiasis, as with other similar dis- eases, can be complicated, partly because symptoms may or may not be present. A diagnosis of balantidiasis may be considered when a patient has diarrhea combined with a possible history of recent exposure to amebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons, or anal intercourse. | No
9800 | NarrativeText | Specifically, a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made by finding B. coli cysts or trophozoites in the patient’s stools or by finding trophozoites in tissue samples (biopsy) taken from the large bowel. A diagnostic blood test has not yet been developed. | No
9801 | Title | Stool examination | No

9803 | Title | Sigmoidoscopy | No
9804 | NarrativeText | To take a tissue sample from the large intestine, a procedure called a sigmoidoscopy is performed. During a sigmoidoscopy, a thin, flexible instrument is used to visually examine the intestinal lining and obtain small tissue specimens. | No
9805 | Title | Treatment | No
9806 | NarrativeText | Patients with balantidiasis are treated with prescrip- tion medication, typically consisting of a ten day course of either tetracycline or metronidazole. Alternative drugs that have proven effective in treating balantidiasis include iodoquinol or paromomycin. | No
9807 | Title | Prognosis | No
9808 | NarrativeText | Although somewhat dependent on the patient’s over- all health, in general, the prognosis for most patients with balantidiasis is good. Severely infected patients occa- sionally die as a result of a tear in the intestinal wall (intestinal perforation) and consequent loss of blood. | No
9809 | Title | Prevention | No
9810 | NarrativeText | There are no immunization procedures or medica- tions that can be taken prior to potential exposure to pre- vent balantidiasis. Moreover, people who have had the disease can become reinfected. Prevention requires effec- tive personal and community hygiene. Specific safe- guards include the following: + Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified by filtering, boiling, or treatment with iodine. | No
9811 | ListItem | * Proper food handling. Measures include protecting food from contamination by flies, cooking food proper- ly, washing one’s hands after using the bathroom and before cooking or eating, and avoiding foods that can- not be cooked or peeled when traveling in countries with high rates of balantidiasis. | No
9812 | ListItem | * Careful disposal of human feces. | No
9813 | ListItem | * Monitoring the contacts of balantidiasis patients. The stools of family members and sexual partners of infect- ed persons should be tested for the presence of cysts or trophozoites. | No

9831 | NarrativeText | Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a nar- rowed heart valve is stretched open using a procedure that does not require open heart surgery. | No
9832 | Title | 442 | No
9833 | Title | Purpose | No
9834 | NarrativeText | There are four valves in the heart, which are located at the exit of each of the four chambers of the heart. They are called aortic valve, pulmonary valve, mitral valve, and tricuspid valve. The valves open and close to regu- late the blood flow from one chamber to the next. They are vital to the efficient functioning of the heart. | No
9835 | NarrativeText | In some people the valves are too narrow (a condi- tion called stenosis). Balloon valvuloplasty is performed on children and adults to improve valve function and blood flow by enlarging the valve opening. It is a treat- ment for aortic, mitral, and pulmonary stenosis. Balloon valvuloplasty has the best results as a treatment for nar- rowed pulmonary valves. Results in treating narrowing of the mitral valve are generally good. It is more difficult to perform and less successful in treating narrowing of the aortic valve. | No
9836 | Title | Description | No
9837 | NarrativeText | Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a thin tube (catheter) that has a small deflated balloon at the tip is inserted through the skin in the groin area into a blood vessel, and then is threaded up to the opening of the nar- rowed heart valve. The balloon is inflated, which stretch- es the valve open. This procedure cures many valve obstructions. It is also called balloon enlargement of a narrowed heart valve. | No
9838 | NarrativeText | The procedure is performed in a cardiac catheteriza- tion laboratory and takes up to four hours. The patient is usually awake, but is given local anesthesia to make the area where the catheter is inserted numb. After the site where the catheter will be inserted is prepared and anesthetized, the cardiologist inserts a catheter into the appropriate blood ves- sel, then passes a balloon-tipped catheter through the first catheter. Guided by a video monitor and an x ray, the physi- cian slowly threads the catheter into the heart. The deflated balloon is positioned in the valve opening, then is inflated repeatedly. The inflated balloon widens the valve’s opening by splitting the valve leaflets apart. Once the valve is widened, the balloon-tipped catheter is removed. The other catheter remains in place for 6 to 12 hours because in some cases the procedure must be repeated. | No
9839 | Title | Preparation | No
9840 | NarrativeText | For at least six hours before balloon valvuloplasty, the patient will have to avoid eating or drinking anything. An intravenous line is inserted so that medications can be administered. The patient’s groin area is shaved and cleaned with an antiseptic. About an hour before the pro- cedure, the patient is given an oral sedative such as diazepam (Valium). | No
9841 | Title | Aftercare | No
9842 | NarrativeText | After balloon valvuloplasty, the patient is sent to the recovery room for several hours, where he or she is moni- tored for vital signs (such as pulse and breathing) and heart sounds. An electrocardiogram, which is a record of the electrical impulses in the heart, is done. The leg in which the catheter was inserted is temporarily prevented from moving. The skin condition is monitored. The insertion site, which will be covered by a sandbag, is observed for bleeding until the catheter is removed. Intravenous fluids will be given to help eliminate the x-ray dye; intravenous blood thinners or other medications to dilate the coronary arteries may be given. Pain medication is available. | No
9843 | NarrativeText | For at least 30 minutes after removal of the catheter, direct pressure is applied to the site of insertion; after this a pressure dressing will be applied. Following discharge from the hospital, the patient can usually resume normal activities. After balloon valvuloplasty lifelong follow-up is necessary because valves sometimes degenerate or narrowing recurs, making surgery necessary. | No
9844 | Title | Risks | No
9845 | NarrativeText | Balloon valvuloplasty can have serious complica- tions. For example, the valve can become misshapen so that it doesn’t close completely, which makes the condi- tion worse. Embolism, where pieces of the valve break off and travel to the brain or the lungs, is another possible risk. If the procedure causes severe damage to the valve leaflets, immediate surgery is required. Less frequent complications are bleeding and hematoma (a local col- lection of clotted blood) at the puncture site, abnormal heart rhythms, reduced blood flow, heart attack, heart puncture, infection, and circulatory problems. | No

9879 | Title | Description | No
9880 | NarrativeText | One of the greatest hazards associated with brain injury is intracranial hypertension. Brain injury may be caused by an accidental head injury or a medical condi- tion, such as stroke, tumor, or infection. When the brain is injured, fluids accumulate in the brain, causing it to swell. The skull does not allow for the expansion of the brain; in effect, the brain becomes compressed. | No
9881 | NarrativeText | If the pressure does not abate, oxygenated blood may not reach all areas of the brain. Also, the brain tissue may be forced against hard, bony edges on the interior of the skull. In either case, the brain tissue may die, causing permanent brain damage or death. | No
9882 | NarrativeText | Barbiturates reduce the metabolic rate of brain tis- sue, as well as the cerebral blood flow. With these reduc- tions, the blood vessels in the brain narrow, decreasing the amount of swelling in the brain. With the swelling relieved, the pressure decreases and some or all brain damage may be averted. | No
9883 | NarrativeText | Controversy exists, however, over the benefits of using barbiturates to control intracranial hypertension. Some studies have shown that barbiturate-induced coma can reduce intracranial hypertension but does not neces- sarily prevent brain damage. Furthermore, the reduction in intracranial hypertension may not be sustained. | No
9884 | Title | Preparation | No
9885 | NarrativeText | Inducing a barbiturate coma is usually kept in reserve for cases in which conventional treatments for controlling intracranial hypertension have failed. Before coma is induced, intracranial hypertension may be treated by hyperventilation; by facilitation of blood flow from the brain; by decompressive surgical proce- dures, such as draining excess fluids from under the skull or from the chambers within the brain (ventricles); or by drug therapy, including osmotherapy, diuretic agents, or steroids. | No
9886 | Title | Risks | No
9887 | NarrativeText | An estimated 25% of barbiturate-induced comas are accompanied by severe side effects. The side effects of barbiturates, especially the depressive effect on the car- diovascular system, can be too risky for some patients. Other side effects include impaired gastrointestinal motility and impaired immune response and infection. Since barbiturates depress activity in the brain, measure- ments of brain activity may be unreliable. Careful moni- toring of the patient is required to ensure nutritional needs are being met and to guard against complications, such as lung infection, fevers, or deep vein blood clots. | No
9888 | Title | Normal results | No

9899 | Title | Purpose | No
9900 | NarrativeText | Barbiturates are in the group of medicines known as central nervous system depressants (CNS). Also known as sedative-hypnotic drugs, barbiturates make people very relaxed, calm, and sleepy. These drugs are sometimes used to help patients relax before surgery. Some may also be used to control seizures (convulsions). Although barbi- turates have been used to treat nervousness and sleep problems, they have generally been replaced by other medicines for these purposes. | No

9906 | NarrativeText | Always take barbiturates exactly as directed. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take the drug for longer than directed. If the medicine does not seem to be working, even after taking it for several weeks, do not increase the dosage. Instead, check with the physician who prescribed the medicine. | No
9907 | NarrativeText | Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without first checking with the physician who prescribed it. It may be necessary to taper down gradually to reduce the chance of withdrawal symptoms. If it is necessary to stop taking the drug, check with the physician for instructions on how to stop. | No
9908 | Title | Precautions | No
9909 | NarrativeText | See a physician regularly while taking barbiturates. The physician will check to make sure the medicine is working as it should and will note unwanted side effects. | No
9910 | NarrativeText | Because barbiturates work on the central nervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and other drugs that slow the central nervous system, such as anti- histamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. They may also add to the effects of anesthetics, including those used for dental proce- dures. The combined effects of barbiturates and alcohol or other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the central nervous system) can be very dangerous, leading to unconsciousness or even death. Anyone taking barbitu- rates should not drink alcohol and should check with his or her physician before taking any medicines classified as CNS depressants. | No
9911 | NarrativeText | Taking an overdose of barbiturates or combining barbiturates with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants can cause unconsciousness and even death.

9915 | NarrativeText | People may feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less alert when using these drugs. These effects may even occur the morning after taking a barbiturate at bedtime. Because of these possible effects, anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do any- thing else that might be dangerous until they have found out how the drugs affect them. | No
9916 | NarrativeText | Barbiturates may cause physical or mental depen- dence when taken over long periods. Anyone who shows these signs of dependence should check with his or her physician right away: + the need to take larger and larger doses of the medicine to get the same effect * a strong desire to keep taking the medicine | No
9917 | ListItem | * withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, nausea or vom- iting, convulsions, trembling, or sleep problems, when the medicine is stopped Children may be especially sensitive to barbiturates. This may increase the chance of side effects such as unusual excitement. | No
9918 | NarrativeText | Older people may also be more sensitive that others to the effects of this medicine. In older people, barbitu- rates may be more likely to cause confusion, depression, and unusual excitement. These effects are also more like- ly in people who are very ill. | No
9919 | Title | Special conditions | No
9920 | NarrativeText | People with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take barbiturates. Before taking these drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of these conditions: ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to barbiturates in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
9921 | NarrativeText | PREGNANCY. Taking barbiturates during pregnancy increases the chance of birth defects and may cause other problems such as prolonged labor and withdrawal effects in the baby after birth. Pregnant women who must take barbiturates for serious or life-threatening condi- tions should thoroughly discuss with their physicians the benefits and risks of taking this medicine. | No
9922 | NarrativeText | BREASTFEEDING. Barbiturates pass into breast milk and may cause problems such as drowsiness, breathing problems, or slow heartbeat in nursing babies whose mothers take the medicine. Women who are breastfeed- ing should check with their physicians before using bar- biturates. | No

9969 | NarrativeText | A barium enema, also known as a lower GI (gastroin- testinal) exam, is a test that uses x-ray examination to view the large intestine. There are two types of this test: the single-contrast technique where barium sulfate is injected into the rectum in order to gain a profile view of the large intestine; and the double-contrast (or “air con- trast”) technique where air is inserted into the rectum. | No
9970 | Title | Purpose | No
9971 | NarrativeText | A barium enema may be performed for a variety of reasons, including to aid in the diagnosis of colon and rectal cancer (or colorectal cancer), and inflammatory disease. Detection of polyps (a benign growth in the tis- sue lining of the colon and rectum), diverticula (a pouch pushing out from the colon), and structural changes in the large intestine can also be established with this test. The double-contrast barium enema is the best method for detecting small tumors (such as polyps), early inflamma- tory disease, and bleeding caused by ulcers. | No
9972 | NarrativeText | The decision to perform a barium enema is based on a person’s history of altered bowel habits. These can include diarrhea, constipation, any lower abdominal pain they are currently exhibiting, blood, mucus, or pus in their stools. It is also recommended that this exam be used every five to 10 years to screen healthy people for colorectal can- cer, the second most deadly type of tumor in the United States. Those who have a close relative with colorectal can- cer or have had a precancerous polyp are considered to be | No
9973 | Title | 447 | No
9974 | NarrativeText | at an increased risk for the disease and should be screened more frequently to look for abnormalities. | No
9975 | Title | Precautions | No
9976 | NarrativeText | While barium enema is an effective screening method in the detection of symptoms and may lead to a timely diagnosis of several diseases, it is not the only method to do this. As of 1997, some studies have shown that the colonoscopy procedure performed by experi- enced gastroenterologists is a more accurate initial diag- nostic tool for detecting early signs of colorectal cancer. A colonoscopy is the most accurate way for the physi- cian to examine the entire colon and rectum for polyps. If abnormalities are seen at this time the procedure is accompanied by a biopsy. Some physicians use sigmoi- doscopy plus a barium enema instead of colonoscopy. | No
9977 | Title | Description | No
9978 | NarrativeText | To begin a barium enema, the patient will lie with their back down on a tilting radiographic table in order to have x rays of the abdomen taken. After being assisted to a different position, a well-lubricated rectal tube is insert- ed through the anus. This tube allows the physician or assistant to slowly administer the barium into the intes- tine. While this filling process is closely monitored, it is important for the patient to keep the anus tightly con- tracted against the rectal tube to help maintain its posi- tion and prevent the barium from leaking. This step is emphasized to the patient due to the inaccuracy that may be caused if the barium leaks. A rectal balloon may also be inflated to help retain the barium. The table may be tilted or the patient moved to a different position to aid in the filling process. | No
9979 | NarrativeText | As the barium fills the intestine, x rays of the abdomen are taken to distinguish significant findings. There are many ways to perform a barium enema. One way is that shortly after filling, the rectal tube is removed and the patient expels as much of the barium as possible. Upon completing this, an additional x ray is taken, and a double-contrast enema may follow. If this is done immediately, a thin film of barium will remain in the intestine, and air is then slowly injected to expand the bowel lumen. Sometimes no x rays will be taken until after the air is injected. | No
9980 | Title | Preparation | No
9981 | NarrativeText | In order to conduct the most accurate barium enema test, the patient must follow a prescribed diet and bowel preparation instructions prior to the test. This preparation commonly includes restricted intake of diary products and a liquid diet for 24 hours prior to the test, in addition | No
9982 | Title | 448 | No
9983 | NarrativeText | to drinking large amounts of water or clear liquids 12-24 hours before the test. Patients may also be given laxa- tives, and asked to give themselves a cleansing enema. | No
9984 | NarrativeText | In addition to the prescribed diet and bowel prepara- tion prior to the test, the patient can expect the following during a barium enema: ¢ They will be well draped with a gown as they are secured to a tilting x-ray table. | No
9985 | ListItem | + As the barium or air is injected into the intestine, they may experience cramping pains or the urge to defecate. | No
9986 | ListItem | + The patient will be instructed to take slow, deep breaths through the mouth to ease any discomfort. | No
9987 | Title | Aftercare | No
9988 | NarrativeText | Patients should follow several steps immediately after undergoing a barium enema, including: + Drink plenty of fluids to help counteract the dehydrat- ing effects of bowel preparation and the test. | No
9989 | ListItem | + Take time to rest. A barium enema and the bowel prepa- ration taken before it can be exhausting. | No
9990 | ListItem | +A cleansing enema may be given to eliminate any remaining barium. Lightly colored stools will be preva- lent for the next 24-72 hours following the test. | No
9991 | Title | Risks | No
9992 | NarrativeText | While a barium enema is considered a safe screen- ing test used on a routine basis, it can cause complica- tions in certain people. The following indications should be kept in mind before a barium enema is performed: * Those who have a rapid heart rate, severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon, or a presumed perforation in the intestine should not undergo a barium enema. | No
9993 | ListItem | + The test can be cautiously performed if the patient has a blocked intestine, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, or severe bloody diarrhea. | No
9994 | ListItem | * Complications that may be caused by the test include perforation of the colon, water intoxication, barium granulomas (inflamed nodules), and allergic reaction. These are all very rare. | No
9995 | Title | Normal results | No
9996 | NarrativeText | When the patient undergoes a single-contrast enema, their intestine is steadily filled with barium to differenti- ate the colon’s markings. A normal result displays uni- form filling of the colon. As the barium is expelled, the intestinal walls collapse. A normal result on the x ray after defecation will show the intestinal lining as having a standard, feathery appearance. | No

10005 | NarrativeText | Accordingly, the double-contrast enema expands the intestine which is already lined with a thin layer of bari- um, but with air to display a detailed image of the mucosal pattern. Varying positions taken by the patient allow the barium to collect on the dependent walls of the intestine by way of gravity. | No
10006 | Title | Abnormal results | No
10007 | NarrativeText | A barium enema allows abnormalities to appear on an x ray that may aid in the diagnosis of several different con- ditions. Although most colon cancers occur in the rectosig- moid region, or upper part of the rectum and adjoining portion of the sigmoid colon, and are better detected with a different test called a proctosigmoidoscopy, an enema can identify other early signs of cancer. | No
10008 | NarrativeText | Identification of polyps, diverticulosis, inflammato- ry disease, such as diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis is attainable through a barium x ray. Structural changes in the intestine, gastroenteritis, and some cases of acute appendicitis may also be apparent by viewing this x ray. | No

10020 | NarrativeText | A Bartholin’s gland cyst is a swollen fluid-filled lump that develops from a blockage of one of the Bartholin’s glands, which are small glands located on each side of the opening to the vagina. Bartholin’s gland cysts and abscess- es are commonly found in women of reproductive age, developing in approximately 2% of all women. | No
10021 | Title | Description | No
10022 | NarrativeText | The Bartholin’s glands are located in the lips of the labia that cover the vaginal opening. The glands (normal- ly the size of a pea) provide moisture for the vulva area. A Bartholin’s gland cyst may form in the gland itself or in the duct draining the gland. A cyst normally does not cause pain, grows slowly, and may go away without treatment. It usually ranges in size from 0.4-1.2 in (1-3 cm), although some may grow much larger. | No
10023 | NarrativeText | If infected, a Bartholin’s gland cyst can form an abscess that will increase in size over several days and is very painful. In order to heal, a Bartholin’s gland cyst usually must be drained. | No
10024 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10025 | NarrativeText | A Bartholin’s gland cyst occurs if the duct becomes blocked for any reason, such as infection, injury, or chronic inflammation. Very rarely a cyst is caused by cancer, which usually occurs only in women over the age of 40. In many cases, the cause of a Bartholin’s gland cyst is unknown. | No
10026 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of an uninfected Bartholin’s gland cyst include a painless lump on one side of the vulva area (most common symptom) and redness or swelling in the vulva area. | No

10033 | ListItem | * increased swelling in the vulva area over a two- to four- day period ¢ drainage from the cyst, normally occurring four to five days after the swelling starts | No
10034 | NarrativeText | Abscesses may be caused by sexually transmitted bacteria, such as those causing chlamydial or gonococcal infections, while others are caused by bacteria normally occurring in the vagina. Over 60 types of bacteria have been found in Bartholin’s gland abscesses. | No
10035 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10036 | NarrativeText | A Bartholin’s gland cyst or abscess is diagnosed by a gynecological pelvic exam. If the cyst appears to be infected, a culture is often performed to identify the type of bacteria causing the abscess. | No
10037 | Title | Treatment | No
10038 | NarrativeText | Treatment for this condition depends on the size of the cyst, whether it is painful, and whether the cyst is infected. | No

10047 | ListItem | * incision and drainage, followed by treatment with silver nitrate to burn the cyst wall so the cyst cannot form a sac and reoccur * removal of the entire Bartholin’s gland cyst, if the cyst has reoccurred several times after use of other treatment methods | No
10048 | NarrativeText | During surgical treatment, the area will be numbed with a local anesthetic to reduce pain. General anesthesia may be used for treatment of an abscess, as the procedure can be painful. | No
10049 | NarrativeText | In a pregnant woman, surgical treatment of cysts that are asymptomatic should be delayed until after delivery to avoid the possibility of excessive bleeding. However, if the Bartholin’s gland is infected and must be drained, antibiotics and local anesthesia are generally considered safe. | No
10050 | NarrativeText | If the cyst is caused by cancer, the gland must be excised, and the woman should be under the care of a gynecologist familiar with the treatment of this type of cancer. | No
10051 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
10052 | NarrativeText | If a Bartholin’s gland cyst has no or mild symptoms, or has opened on its own to drain, a woman may decide to use watchful waiting, warm sitz baths, and non-pre- scription pain medication. If symptoms become worse or do not improve, a health care professional should then be consulted. | No
10053 | NarrativeText | Infected Bartholin’s glands should be evaluated and treated by a health care professional. | No
10054 | Title | Prognosis | No
10055 | NarrativeText | A Bartholin’s gland cyst should respond to treatment in a few days. If an abscess requires surgery, healing may take days to weeks, depending on the size of the abscess and the type of surgical procedure used. Most of the sur- gical procedures, except for incision and drainage, should be effective in preventing recurring infections. | No
10056 | Title | Prevention | No
10057 | NarrativeText | There are few ways to prevent the formation of Bartholin’s gland cysts or abscesses. However, as a Bartholin’s gland abscess may be caused by a sexually transmitted disease, the practice of safe sex is recommend- ed. Using good hygiene, i.e., wiping front to back after a bowel movement, is also recommended to prevent bacteria from the bowels from contaminating the vaginal area. | No

10066 | Title | Definition | No
10067 | NarrativeText | Bartonellosis is an infectious bacterial disease with an acute form (which has a sudden onset and short course) and a chronic form (which has more gradual onset and longer duration). The disease is transmitted by sandflies and occurs in western South America. Charac- terized by a form of red blood cell deficiency (hemolytic anemia) and fever, the potentially fatal acute form is called Oroya fever or Carrion’s disease. The chronic form is identified by painful skin lesions. | No
10068 | Title | Description | No

10076 | NarrativeText | Vector—An organism, such as insects or rodents, that can transmit disease to humans. | No
10077 | NarrativeText | More than 7,000 people perished. Some survivors later developed a skin disease, called verruga peruana (Peru- vian warts). These skin lesions were observed prior to the 1871 outbreak—perhaps as far back as the pre- Columbian era—but a connection to Oroya fever was unknown. In 1885, a young medical researcher, Daniel Carrion, inoculated himself with blood from a lesion to study the course of the skin disease. When he became ill with Oroya fever, the connection became apparent. Oroya fever is often called Carrion’s disease in honor of his fatal experiment. | No
10078 | NarrativeText | The bacteria, Bartonella bacilliformis, was isolated by Alberto Barton in 1909, but wasn’t identified as the cause of the fever until 1940. The Bartonella genus includes at least 11 bacteria species, four of which cause human diseases, including cat-scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis. However, bartonellosis refers exclusively to the disease caused by B. bacilliformis. The disease is limited to a small area of the Andes Mountains in western South America; nearly all cases have been in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A large outbreak involving thousands of people occurred in 1940-41, but bartonel- losis has since occurred sporadically. Control of sand- flies, the only known disease carrier (vector), has been credited with managing the disease. | No
10079 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10080 | NarrativeText | Bartonellosis is transmitted by the nocturnal sandfly and arises from infection with B. bacilliformis. The sand- fly, Lutzomyia verrucarum, dines on human blood and, in so doing, can inject bacteria into the bloodstream. The sandfly is found only in certain areas of the Peruvian Andes; other, as-yet-unidentified vectors are suspected in Ecuador and Colombia. | No
10081 | NarrativeText | Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria latch onto red blood cells (erythrocytes), burrow into the cells, and reproduce. In the process, up to 90% of the host’s ery- throcytes are destroyed, causing severe hemolytic ane- mia. The anemia is accompanied by high fever, muscle and joint pain, delirium, and possibly coma. | No
10082 | NarrativeText | Two to eight weeks after the acute phase, an infected individual develops verruga peruana. However, individu- als may exhibit the characteristic lesions without ever experiencing the acute phase. Left untreated, the lesions may last months or years. These lesions resemble blood- filled blisters, up to 1.6 in (4 cm) in diameter, and appear primarily on the head and limbs. They can be painful to the touch and may bleed or ulcerate. | No
10083 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10084 | NarrativeText | Bartonellosis is identified by symptoms and the patient’s history, such as recent travel in areas where bar- tonellosis occurs. Isolation of B. bacilliformis from the bloodstream or lesions can confirm the diagnosis. | No
10085 | Title | Treatment | No
10086 | NarrativeText | Antibiotics are the mainstay of bartonellosis treat- ment. The bacteria are susceptible to several antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, penicillins, and aminogly- cosides. Blood transfusions may be necessary to treat the anemia caused by bartonellosis. | No
10087 | Title | Prognosis | No
10088 | NarrativeText | Antibiotics have dramatically decreased the fatality associated with bartonellosis. Prior to the development of antibiotics, the fever was fatal in 40% of cases. With antibiotic treatment, that rate has dropped to 8%. Fatali- ties can result from complications associated with severe anemia and secondary infections. Once the infection is halted, an individual can recover fully. | No

Approximately 14% of children in the United States are physically abused each year, and an estimated 2,000 of those children die as a result of the abuse. Between 1994-1995, 1.1 million cases of child abuse were recorded in the United States; of that number, 55% of the victims were less than a year old. | No
10106 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10107 | NarrativeText | Battered child syndrome (BCS) is found at every level of society, although the incidence may be higher in low-income households where adult caregivers suffer greater stress and social difficulties, without having had the benefit of higher education. The child abuser most often injures a child in the heat of anger, and was often abused as a child himself. The incessant crying of an infant or child may trigger abuse. Symptoms may include a delayed visit to the emergency room with an injured child; an implausible explanation of the cause of a child’s injury; bruises that match the shape of a hand, fist or belt; cigarette burns; scald marks; bite marks; black eyes; unconsciousness; bruises around the neck; and a bulging fontanel in infants. | No
10108 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10109 | NarrativeText | Battered child syndrome is most often diagnosed by an emergency room physician or pediatrician, or by teachers or social workers. Physical examination will detect bruises, burns, swelling, retinal hemorrhages. X rays, and other imaging techniques, such as MRI or scans may confirm fractures or other internal injuries. The presence of injuries at different stages of healing (i.e. having occurred at different times)is nearly always indicative of BCS. Establishing the diagnosis is often hindered by the excessive cautiousness of caregivers or by actual concealment of the true origin of the child,s injuries, as a result of fear, shame and avoidance or denial mechanisms. | No
10110 | Title | Treatment | No
10111 | NarrativeText | Medical treatment for battered child syndrome will vary according to the type of injury incurred. Counseling and the implementation of an intervention plan for the child’s parents or guardians is necessary. The child abuser may be incarcerated, and/or the abused child removed from the home to prevent further harm. Reporting child abuse to authorities is mandatory for doctors, teachers, and childcare workers in most states as a way to prevent continued abuse. Both physical and psychological therapy are often recommended as treatment for the abused child. | No
10112 | Title | Prognosis | No
10113 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for battered child syndrome will depend on the severity of injury, actions taken by the authorities to ensure the future safety of the injured child, and the willingness of parents or guardians to seek coun- seling for themselves as well as for the child. | No
10114 | Title | Prevention | No
10115 | NarrativeText | Recognizing the potential for child abuse in a situa- tion, and the seeking or offering of intervention and counseling before battered child syndrome occurs is the best way to prevent it. Signs that physical abuse may be forthcoming include parental alcohol or substance abuse; previous abuse of the child or the child’s siblings; history of mental or emotional problems in parents; parents | No

10129 | Title | Definition | No
10130 | NarrativeText | Bed-wetting is the unintentional (involuntary) dis- charge of urine during the night. Although most children between the ages of three and five begin to stay dry at night, the age at which children are physically and emo- tionally ready to maintain complete bladder control varies. Enuresis is a technical term that refers to the con- tinued, usually involuntary, passage of urine during the night or the day after the age at which control is expected. | No
10131 | Title | Description | No
10132 | NarrativeText | Most children wet the bed occasionally, and defini- tions of the age and frequency at which bed-wetting becomes a medical problem vary somewhat. Many researchers consider bed-wetting normal until age 6. | No
10133 | NarrativeText | About 10% of 6-year-old children wet the bed about once a month. More boys than girls have this problem. The American Psychiatric Association, however, defines enuresis as repeated voiding of urine into the bed or clothes at age five or older. The wetting is usually invol- untary but in some cases it is intentional. For a diagnosis of enuresis, wetting must occur twice a week for at least three months with no underlying physiological cause. Enuresis, both nighttime (nocturnal) and daytime (diur- nal), at age five affects 7% of boys and 3% of girls. By age 10, it affects 3% of boys and 2% of girls; only 1% of adolescents experience enuresis. | No
10134 | NarrativeText | Enuresis is divided into two classes. A child with primary enuresis has never established bladder control. A child with secondary enuresis begins to wet after a pro- longed dry period. Some children have both nocturnal and diurnal enuresis. | No
10135 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10136 | NarrativeText | The causes of bed-wetting are not entirely known. It tends to run in families. Most children with primary enure- sis have a close relative—a parent, aunt, or uncle—who also had the disorder. About 70% of children with two par- ents who wet the bed will also wet the bed. Twin studies have shown that both of a pair of identical twins experience enuresis more often than both of a pair of fraternal twins. | No
10137 | NarrativeText | Sometimes bed-wetting can be caused by a serious medical problem like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, or epilepsy. Snoring and episodes of interrupted breathing during sleep (sleep apnea) occasionally contribute to bed-wetting problems. Enlarged adenoids can cause these conditions. Other physiological problems, such as urinary tract infection, severe constipation, or spinal cord injury, can cause bed-wetting. | No
10138 | NarrativeText | Children who wet the bed frequently may have a smaller than normal functional bladder capacity. Func- tional bladder capacity is the amount of urine a person can hold in the bladder before feeling a strong urge to urinate. When functional capacity is small, the bladder will not hold all the urine produced during the night. Tests have shown that bladder size in these children is normal. Nevertheless, they experience frequent strong urges to urinate. Such children urinate often during the daytime and may wet several times at night. Although a small functional bladder capacity may be caused by a developmental delay, it may also be that the child’s habit of voiding frequently slows bladder development. | No
10139 | NarrativeText | Parents often report that their bed-wetting child is an extremely sound sleeper and difficult to wake. However, several research studies found that bed-wetting children have normal sleep patterns and that bed-wetting can occur in any stage of sleep. | No
10140 | Title | 454 | No
10141 | NarrativeText | Recent medical research has found that many chil- dren who wet the bed may have a deficiency of an impor- tant hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH helps to concentrate urine during sleep hours, meaning that the urine contains less water and therefore takes up less space. This decreased volume of water usu- ally prevents the child’s bladder from overfilling during the night, unless the child drank a lot just before going to bed. Testing of many bed-wetting children has shown that these children do not have the usual increase in ADH during sleep. Children who wet the bed, therefore, often produce more urine during the hours of sleep than their bladders can hold. If they do not wake up, the bladder releases the excess urine and the child wets the bed. | No
10142 | NarrativeText | Research demonstrates that in most cases bed-wet- ting does not indicate that the child has a physical or psy- chological problem. Children who wet the bed usually have normal-sized bladders and have sleep patterns that are no different from those of non-bed-wetting children. Sometimes emotional stress, such as the birth of a sib- ling, a death in the family, or separation from the family, may be associated with the onset of bed-wetting in a pre- viously toilet-trained child. Daytime wetting, however, may indicate that the problem has a physical cause. | No
10143 | NarrativeText | While most children have no long-term problems as a result of bed-wetting, some children may develop psy- chological problems. Low self-esteem may occur when these children, who already feel embarrassed, are further humiliated by angry or frustrated parents who punish them or who are overly aggressive about toilet training. The problem can by aggravated when playmates tease or when social activities such as sleep-away camp are avoided for fear of teasing. | No
10144 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10145 | NarrativeText | If a child continues to wet the bed after the age of six, parents may feel the need to seek evaluation and diagnosis by the family doctor or a children’s specialist (pediatrician). Typically, before the doctor can make a diagnosis, a thorough medical history is obtained. Then the child receives a physical examination, appropriate laboratory tests, including a urine test (urinalysis), and, if necessary, radiologic studies (such as x rays). | No
10146 | NarrativeText | If the child is healthy and no physical problem is found, which is the case 90% of the time, the doctor may not rec- ommend treatment but rather may provide the parents and the child with reassurance, information, and advice. | No
10147 | Title | Treatment | No
10148 | NarrativeText | Occasionally a doctor will determine that the prob- lem is serious enough to require treatment. Standard treatments for bed-wetting include bladder training exercises, motivational therapy, drug therapy, psy- chotherapy, and diet therapy. | No
10149 | NarrativeText | Bladder training exercises are based on the theory that those who wet the bed have small functional bladder capacity. Children are told to drink a large quantity of water and to try to prolong the periods between urina- tions. These exercises are designed to increase bladder capacity but are only successful in resolving bed-wetting in a small number of patients. | No
10150 | NarrativeText | In motivational therapy, parents attempt to encour- age the child to combat bed-wetting, but the child must want to achieve success. Positive reinforcement, such as praise or rewards for staying dry, can help improve self- image and resolve the condition. Punishment for “wet” nights will hamper the child’s self-esteem and compound the problem. | No
10151 | NarrativeText | The following motivational techniques are common- used: ¢ Behavior modification. This method of therapy is aimed at helping children take responsibility for their nighttime bladder control by teaching new behaviors. For example, children are taught to use the bathroom before bedtime and to avoid drinking fluids after din- ner. While behavior modification generally produces good results, it is long-term treatment. | No
10152 | ListItem | ¢ Alarms. This form of therapy uses a sensor placed in the child’s pajamas or in a bed pad. This sensor triggers an alarm that wakes the child at the first sign of wet- ness. If the child is awakened, he or she can then go to the bathroom and finish urinating. The intention is to condition a response to awaken when the bladder is full. Bed-wetting alarms require the motivation of both parents and children. They are considered the most effective form of treatment now available. | No
10153 | NarrativeText | A number of drugs are also used to treat bed-wetting. These medications are usually fast acting; children often respond to them within the first week of treatment. Among the drugs commonly used are a nasal spray of desmo- pressin acetate (DDAVP), a substance similar to the hor- mone that helps regulate urine production; and imipramine hydrochloride, a drug that helps to increase bladder capac- ity. Studies show that imipramine is effective for as many as 50% of patients. However, children often wet the bed again after the drug is discontinued, and it has some side effects. Some bed-wetting with an underlying physical cause can be treated by surgical procedures. These causes include enlarged adenoids that cause sleep apnea, physical defects in the urinary system, or a spinal tumor. | No
10154 | NarrativeText | Psychotherapy is indicated when the child exhibits signs of severe emotional distress in response to events such as a death in the family, the birth of a new child, a change in schools, or divorce. Psychotherapy is also indi- cated if a child shows signs of persistently low self- esteem or depression. | No
10155 | NarrativeText | In rare cases, allergies or intolerances to certain foods—such as dairy products, citrus products, or choco- late—can cause bed-wetting. When children have food sensitivities, bed-wetting may be helped by discovering the substances that trigger the allergic response and elim- inating these substances from the child’s diet. | No
10156 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
10157 | NarrativeText | A number of alternative treatments are available for bed-wetting. | No
10158 | Title | Massage | No
10159 | NarrativeText | According to practitioners of this technique, pres- sure applied to various points on the body may help alle- viate the condition. Acupressure or massage, when done by a trained therapist, may also be helpful in bed-wetting caused by a neurologic problem. | No
10160 | Title | Herbal and homeopathic remedies | No
10161 | NarrativeText | Some herbal remedies, such as horsetail (Equisetum arvense) have also been used to treat bed-wetting. A trained homeopathic practitioner, working at the consti- tutional level, will seek to rebalance the child’s vital force, eliminating the imbalanced behavior of bed-wet- ting. Common homeopathic remedies used in this treat- ment include Causticum, Lycopodium, and Pulsatilla. | No
10162 | Title | Hypnosis | No
10163 | NarrativeText | Hypnosis is another approach that is being used suc- cessfully by practitioners trained in this therapy. It trains the child to awaken and go to the bathroom when his or her bladder feels full. Hypnosis is less expensive, less time-consuming, and less dangerous than most approaches; it has virtually no side effects. Recent med- ical studies show that hypnotherapy can work quickly— within four to six sessions. | No
10164 | Title | Prognosis | No
10165 | NarrativeText | Occasional bed-wetting is not a disease and it does not have a “cure.” If the child has no underlying physical or psychological problem that is causing the bed-wetting, in most cases he or she will outgrow the condition with- out treatment. About 15% of bedwetters become dry each year after age 6. If bed-wetting is frequent, accompanied by daytime wetting, or falls into the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic definition of enuresis, a doctor | No

10230 | NarrativeText | Prompt medical attention can prevent surface pres- sure sores from deepening into more serious infections. For mild bedsores, treatment involves relieving pressure, keeping the wound clean and moist, and keeping the area around the ulcer clean and dry. Antiseptics, harsh soaps, and other skin cleansers can damage new tissue, so a saline solution should be used to cleanse the wound whenever a fresh non-stick dressing is applied. | No
10231 | NarrativeText | The patient’s doctor may prescribe infection-fight- ing antibiotics, special dressings or drying agents, or lotions or ointments to be applied to the wound in a thin film three or four times a day. Warm whirlpool treat- ments are sometimes recommended for sores on the arm, hand, foot, or leg. | No
10232 | NarrativeText | In a procedure called debriding, a scalpel may be used to remove dead tissue or other debris from the wound. Deep, ulcerated sores that don’t respond to other therapy may require skin grafts or plastic surgery. | No

10244 | Title | Prevention | No
10245 | NarrativeText | It is usually possible to prevent bedsores from devel- oping or worsening. The patient should be inspected reg- ularly; should bathe or shower every day, using warm water and mild soap; and should avoid cold or dry air. A bedridden patient should be repositioned at least once every two hours while awake. A person who uses a wheelchair should shift his weight every 10 or 15 min- utes, or be helped to reposition himself at least once an hour. It is important to lift, rather than drag, a person being repositioned. Bony parts of the body should not be massaged. Even slight friction can remove the top layer of skin and damage blood vessels beneath it. | No
10246 | NarrativeText | If the patient is bedridden, sensitive body parts can be protected by: * sheepskin pads * special cushions placed on top of a mattress | No
10247 | ListItem | * a water-filled mattress *a variable-pressure mattress whose sections can be individually inflated or deflated to redistribute pressure | No
10248 | NarrativeText | Pillows or foam wedges can prevent a bedridden patient’s ankles from irritating each other, and pillows placed under the legs from mid-calf to ankle can raise the heels off the bed. Raising the head of the bed slightly and briefly can provide relief, but raising the head of the bed more than 30 degrees can cause the patient to slide, thereby causing damage to skin and tiny blood vessels. | No
10249 | NarrativeText | A person who uses a wheelchair should be encour- aged to sit up as straight as possible. Pillows behind the head and between the legs can help prevent bedsores, as can a special cushion placed on the chair seat. Donut- shaped cushions should not be used because they restrict blood flow and cause tissues to swell. | No

10273 | NarrativeText | Behcet’s syndrome is a chronic disease that involves multiple body systems. The disease is named for a Turk- ish dermatologist, Hulusi Behcet, who first reported a patient with recurrent mouth and genital ulcers along with uveitis in 1937. The disease occurs worldwide, but is most prevalent in Japan, the Middle East, and in the Mediterranean region. There is a wider prevalence among males than females in a ratio of two to one. | No
10274 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10275 | NarrativeText | The cause of Behcet’s syndrome is unknown. Symp- toms include recurring ulcers in the mouth or the genital area, skin lesions, arthritis that affects mainly the knees and ankles, pain and irritation in the eyes, and fever. The mouth and genital ulcers tend to occur in multiples and can be quite painful. In the mouth, these ulcers are gener- ally found on the tongue, gums, and the inside of the lips or jaws. In the genital area, the ulcers usually occur on the penis and scrotum in males and on the vulva of women. The eye inflammation can lead to blindness. | No
10276 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10277 | NarrativeText | Because Behcet’s syndrome is a multisystem disease, it is difficult to diagnose. International criteria have been proposed to assist in classifying this disease. There is no one diagnostic feature of this disease, so diagnosis depends on grouping together enough symptoms in order to identify the disease. Symptoms of Behcet’s syndrome also occur in other diseases, so it is often necessary to rule out the other diseases before a definitive diagnosis can be reached. | No

10285 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for Behcet’s syndrome is generally poor. There has been a documented case of Behcet’s last- ing for 17 years. Although the disease is considered painful but not fatal, when the central nervous system is involved there is usually severe disability and death often occurs. The condition is usually chronic, although there can be remissions during the course of the disease. | No

10312 | NarrativeText | Bejel has many other names depending on the locali- ty: siti, dichuchwa, njovera, belesh, and skerljevo are some of the names. It is most commonly found in the Middle East (Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq), Africa, central Asia, and Australia. Bejel is related to yaws and pinta, but has different symptoms. | No
10313 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10314 | NarrativeText | Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes bejel, is very closely related to the one that causes the sexually transmitted form of syphilis, but transmission is very dif- ferent. In bejel, transmission is by direct contact, with broken skin or contaminated hands, or indirectly by shar- ing drinking vessels and eating utensils. T. pallidum is passed on mostly between children living in poverty in very unsanitary environments and with poor hygiene. | No
10315 | NarrativeText | The skin, bones, and mucous membranes are affect- ed by bejel. Patches and ulcerated sores are common in the mouth, throat, and nasal passages. Gummy lesions may form, even breaking through the palate. Other find- ings may include a region of swollen lymph nodes and deep bone pain in the legs. Eventually, bones may become deformed. | No
10316 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10317 | NarrativeText | T. pallidum can be detected by microscopic study of samples taken from the sores or lymph fluid. However, since antibody tests don’t distinguish between the types of syphilis, specific diagnosis of the type of syphilis depends on the patient’s history, symptoms, and environment. | No

10335 | NarrativeText | Bell’s palsy describes an unexplained weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. Afflict- ed individuals may be unable to close the eye on the affected side of the face, and may also experience tear- ing, drooling, and hypersensitive hearing. The onset can be quite sudden, sometimes occurring overnight. Although Bell’s palsy is unsettling and inconvenient, it is typically not indicative of a serious health problem. The weakness and paralysis resolve completely in the majori- ty of cases. | No
10336 | Title | Description | No
10337 | NarrativeText | Bell’s palsy has been described as a diagnosis of exclusion because several other disorders present similar symptoms. Facial palsies have been linked to conditions such as Lyme disease, ear infection, meningitis, syphilis, German measles (rubella), mumps, chicken- pox (varicella), and infection with Epstein-Barr virus (e.g., infectious mononucleosis). True Bell’s palsy is an idiopathic facial palsy, meaning the root cause cannot be identified. Although Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, it can present symptoms similar to truly serious conditions, such as a stroke, ruptured aneurysm, or tumors. | No
10338 | NarrativeText | Every year, approximately 40,000-65,000 Americans are stricken with Bell’s palsy. Worldwide, there is an annual incidence of 20-30 cases per 100,000 individuals. An individual can be affected at any age, but young and middle-aged adults are the most likely to be affected. It is unusual to see Bell’s palsy in people less than 10 years old. Bell’s palsy can affect either side of the face, and nei- ther gender seems to be at a greater risk. Pregnant women and individuals with diabetes, influenza, a cold, or an upper respiratory infection seem to be at a greater risk. Although it cannot be considered a serious condition from a health standpoint, it can cause extreme stress, embar- rassment, and inconvenience for those affected. | No
10339 | NarrativeText | In the large majority of cases (80-85%), the facial weakness or paralysis is temporary. However, individuals who experience complete paralysis seem to have a poorer recovery rate with only 60% returning to normal. Approx- imately 4-6% of all Bell’s palsy cases result in permanent facial deformity, and another 10-15% experience perma- nent problems with spasms, twitching, or contracted mus- cles. Between 2% and 7.3% of individuals who have experienced Bell’s palsy will have a recurrence. On aver- age, the first recurrence happens 9.8 years after the first episode; the second, 6.7 years later. One recurrence is very infrequent, and a second is extremely rare. | No
10340 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10341 | NarrativeText | The symptoms of Bell’s palsy arise from an inflam- mation or swelling of the seventh cranial nerve, other- wise called the facial nerve. Both sides of the face have a facial nerve which controls the muscles on that side of the face. The course of the facial nerve passes through a bony canal in the skull. When the nerve becomes swollen, it is compressed since the canal does not allow for any expansion. As further swelling increases the com- pression, nerve signal conduction is impeded or even prevented. The interference with the nerve signals is seen in the loss of muscle control and tone. | No
10342 | NarrativeText | Why the facial nerve becomes inflamed in Bell’s palsy is a matter of some debate, and medical researchers and doctors are not in complete agreement. The best-sup- ported evidence implicates the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is responsible for cold sores and fever | No

10345 | NarrativeText | blisters. HSV infection has been discovered in up to 70% of Bell’s palsy cases. Most people harbor this virus, although they may not exhibit symptoms. | No
10346 | NarrativeText | The major symptom of Bell’s palsy is one-sided facial weakness or paralysis. Muscle control is either inadequate or completely missing. There may also be involuntary facial movements, such as twitches, that accompany certain facial expressions. Afflicted individu- als frequently have difficulty shutting the affected eye and may not be able to close it at all. | No
10347 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10348 | NarrativeText | Although Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, it shares symptoms in common with serious conditions, such as stroke. Therefore, emergency medical attention is a wise and necessary precaution. Bell’s palsy affects the facial nerve, unlike most strokes associated with facial weakness which affect higher nerve centers ultimately supplying the facial nerve. These two disorders can be distinquished clinically because most strokes do not cause weakness of the forehead or eyelid muscles. | No
10349 | NarrativeText | The fact that Bell’s palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion becomes apparent in the course of the medical examina- tion—the usual mode of examination is to rule out other disorders until only Bell’s palsy is left. Disorders that need to be excluded include demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis), stroke, tumors, bacterial or viral infection, and bone fracture. | No
10350 | NarrativeText | During the physical examination, the afflicted indi- vidual is asked about recent illnesses, accidents, infec- tions, and any other symptoms. A visual exam of the ears, throat, and sinus is done, and hearing is tested. The extent of the symptoms is assessed by grading the sym- metry of the face at rest and during voluntary move- ments, such as wrinkling the forehead, puckering the lips, and closing the affected eye. Involuntary move- ments are assessed in combination with the voluntary movements. Neurologic exam is done to rule out involvement of other parts of the nervous system except for the facial muscles, which would exclude the diagno- sis of Bell’s palsy. | No
10351 | NarrativeText | In response to the individual’s medical history, blood tests and possibly a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are ordered. The results of these tests help determine the presence of a bacterial or viral infection or an inflammatory disease. Electrophysiological tests, in which a muscle or nerve is artificially stimulated, may be used to assess the condition of facial muscles and the facial nerve. Common tests include electromyography, which measures voluntary muscle movement, and nerve conduction velocity, which determines the extent of nerve degeneration. Radiological tests may also be included, such as an x ray, as well as imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography. These tests—especially MRI—allow an excellent view of the nerve itself. | No
10352 | NarrativeText | Once all other possibilities are exhausted, a diagno- sis of Bell’s palsy is made. The following weeks are a period of watchful waiting. Further examinations are done to track recovery. Results from nerve conduction tests may be used to predict an outcome. However, this use is questioned by some doctors and medical researchers since evidence for their predictive value is inconclusive. | No
10353 | NarrativeText | If facial movement, even a small amount, has not returned within 3-4 months, the diagnosis of Bell’s palsy may need to be reevaluated. | No
10354 | Title | Treatment | No
10355 | NarrativeText | Many doctors prescribe an antiviral and/or a steroid for Bell’s palsy, but there is some controversy about whether these drugs actually help. The consensus opin- ion seems to be that, although drugs might not be neces- sary, they are not dangerous, and they may help in some cases, especially if there is complete paralysis. If drugs are used, they need to be taken as soon as possible fol- lowing the onset of symptoms. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir, are prescribed to destroy actively replicating viruses and prevent further damage to the facial nerve. Steroids, such as prednisone, are thought to be useful in reducing swelling and, there- fore, compression on the nerve. | No
10356 | NarrativeText | In the past, surgery was performed to relieve the compression on the nerve. However, this treatment option is now used very infrequently because it does not guarantee recovery, and it carries the risk of permanent nerve damage. | No
10357 | NarrativeText | The need to protect the affected eye is universally promoted. Since the individual may not be able to lower the affected eyelid, the eye may become dry, particularly at night. Excessive dryness can damage the cornea. Day- time treatment includes artificial tears and may include an eye patch or other protective measures. Nighttime treatment involves a more intense effort at keeping the eye protected. Eye lubricants or viscous ointments, along with taping the eye shut, are frequently recommended. | No
10358 | NarrativeText | In cases of permanent nerve damage, cosmetic treat- ment options, such as therapeutic injections of botulism toxin or surgery, may be sought or suggested. | No
10359 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
10360 | NarrativeText | Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have historically used acupuncture to treat Bell’s palsy. There are also some indications that facial massage and chiro- practic manipulation may help treat the symptoms and improve the outcome. There are also claims of therapeu- tic value for local injections or ingestion of vitamin B,, supplements. | No
10361 | Title | Prognosis | No
10362 | NarrativeText | Most individuals with Bell’s palsy begin to notice improvement in their condition within 2-3 weeks of the symptoms’ onset. At least 80% of them will be fully recov- ered within three months. Among the other 20% of afflict- ed individuals, symptoms may take longer to resolve or they may be permanent. Individuals suffering permanent nerve damage may not regain control of the muscles on the affected side of the face. These muscles may remain weak or paralyzed. If the nerve recovers imperfectly, they may experience involuntary facial twitches or spasms that accompany normal facial expressions. | No

10390 | NarrativeText | Other diseases involving cancerous or excessive growth of plasma cells or cells similar to plasma cells can cause Bence Jones proteins in the urine.

10393 | NarrativeText | A routine urinalysis will not detect Bence Jones proteins. There are several methods used by laboratories to detect and measure these proteins. The classic Bence Jones reaction involves heating urine to 140°F (60°C). At this temperature, the Bence Jones proteins will clump. The clumping disappears if the urine is further heated to boiling and reappears when the urine is cooled. Other clumping procedures using salts, acids, and other chemi- cals are also used to detect these proteins. These types of | No

10448 | NarrativeText | Benzodiazepines are medicines that help relieve ner- vousness, tension, and other symptoms by slowing the central nervous system. | No
10449 | Title | Purpose | No
10450 | NarrativeText | Benzodiazepines are a type of antianxiety drugs. While anxiety is a normal response to stressful situa- tions, some people have unusually high levels of anxiety that can interfere with everyday life. For these people, benzodiazepines can help bring their feelings under con- trol. The medicine can also relieve troubling symptoms of anxiety, such as pounding heartbeat, breathing prob- lems, irritability, nausea, and faintness. | No
10451 | NarrativeText | Physicians may sometimes prescribe these drugs for other conditions, such as muscle spasms, epilepsy and other seizure disorders, phobias, panic disorder, with- drawal from alcohol, and sleeping problems. However, this medicine should not be used every day for sleep problems that last more than a few days. If used this way, the drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks. | No
10452 | NarrativeText | Benzodiazepines should not be used to relieve the nervousness and tension of normal everyday life. | No
10453 | Title | Description | No
10454 | NarrativeText | The family of antianxiety drugs known as benzodi- azepines includes alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan). These medicines take effect fairly quickly, starting to work within an hour after they are taken. Benzodiazepines are | No
10455 | Title | 466 | No
10456 | NarrativeText | available only with a physician’s prescription and are available in tablet, capsule, liquid, or injectable forms. | No
10457 | Title | Recommended dosage | No
10458 | NarrativeText | The recommended dosage depends on the type of benzodiazepine, its strength, and the condition for which it is being taken. Doses may be different for different people. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage. | No
10459 | NarrativeText | Always take benzodiazepines exactly as directed. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take the drug for longer than directed. If the medicine does not seem to be working, check with the physician who pre- scribed it. Do not increase the dose or stop taking the medicine unless the physician says to do so. Stopping the drug suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms, espe- cially if it has been taken in large doses or over a long period. People who are taking the medicine for seizure disorders may have seizures if they stop taking it sudden- ly. If it is necessary to stop taking the medicine, check with a physician for directions on how to stop. The physi- cian may recommend tapering down gradually to reduce the chance of withdrawal symptoms or other problems. | No
10460 | Title | Precautions | No
10461 | NarrativeText | Seeing a physician regularly while taking benzodi- azepines is important, especially during the first few months of treatment. The physician will check to make sure the medicine is working as it should and will note unwanted side effects. | No
10462 | NarrativeText | People who take benzodiazepines to relieve nervous- ness, tension, or symptoms of panic disorder should check with their physicians every two to three months to make sure they still need to keep taking the medicine. | No
10463 | NarrativeText | Patients who are taking benzodiazepines for sleep problems should check with their physicians if they are not sleeping better within 7-10 days. Sleep problems that last longer than this may be a sign of another medical problem. | No
10464 | NarrativeText | People who take this medicine to help them sleep may have trouble sleeping when they stop taking the medicine. This effect should last only a few nights. | No
10465 | NarrativeText | Some people, especially older people, feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less alert when using benzodi- azepines. The drugs may also cause clumsiness or unsteadiness. When the medicine is taken at bedtime, these effects may even occur the next morning. Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else that might be dangerous until they have found out how the drugs affect them. | No
10466 | NarrativeText | Benzodiazepines may also cause behavior changes in some people, similar to those seen in people who act differently when they drink alcohol. More extreme changes, such as confusion, agitation, and hallucina- tions, also are possible. Anyone who starts having strange or unusual thoughts or behavior while taking this medicine should get in touch with his or her physician. | No
10467 | NarrativeText | Because benzodiazepines work on the central ner- vous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and other drugs that slow down the central nervous system, such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. They may also add to the effects of anesthetics, including those used for dental pro- cedures. These effects may last several days after treat- ment with benzodiazepines ends. The combined effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol or other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the central nervous system) can be very dangerous, leading to unconsciousness or, rarely, even death. Anyone taking benzodiazepines should not drink alcohol and should check with his or her physician before using any CNS depressants. Taking an overdose of benzo- diazepines can also cause unconsciousness and possibly death. Anyone who shows signs of an overdose or of the effects of combining benzodiazepines with alcohol or other drugs should get immediate emergency help. Warn- ing signs include slurred speech or confusion, severe drowsiness, staggering, and profound weakness. | No
10468 | NarrativeText | Some benzodiazepines may change the results of certain medical tests. Before having medical tests, any- one taking this medicine should alert the health care pro- fessional in charge. | No
10469 | NarrativeText | Children are generally more sensitive than adults to the effects of benzodiazepines. This sensitivity may increase the chance of side effects. | No
10470 | NarrativeText | Older people are more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of this medicine and may be at greater risk for side effects. Older people who take these drugs to help them sleep may be drowsy during the day. Older people also increase their risk of falling and injuring themselves when they take these drugs. | No
10471 | Title | Special conditions | No
10472 | NarrativeText | People with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take benzodiazepines. Before taking these drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of these conditions: ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to benzodiazepines or other mood-altering drugs in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No
10473 | NarrativeText | PREGNANCY. Some benzodiazepines increase the likelihood of birth defects. Using these medicines during pregnancy may also cause the baby to become dependent on them and to have withdrawal symptoms after birth. When taken late in pregnancy or around the time of labor and delivery, these drugs can cause other problems in the newborn baby, such as weakness, breathing problems, slow heartbeat, and body temperature problems. | No
10474 | NarrativeText | Women who are pregnant or who may become preg- nant should not use benzodiazepines unless their anxiety is so severe that it threatens their pregnancy. Any woman who must take this medicine while pregnant should be sure to thoroughly discuss its risks and benefits with her physician. | No
10475 | NarrativeText | BREASTFEEDING. Benzodiazepines may pass into breast milk and cause problems in babies whose mothers taken the medicine. These problems include drowsiness, breathing problems, and slow heartbeat. Women who are breastfeeding their babies should not use this medicine without checking with their physicians. | No
10476 | NarrativeText | OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ben- zodiazepines, people with any of these medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of their con- ditions: * current or past drug or alcohol abuse ¢ depression | No

10527 | NarrativeText | Beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of thi- amine (vitamin B,) that affects many systems of the body, including the muscles, heart, nerves, and digestive system. Beriberi literally means “I can’t, I can’t” in Sing- halese, which reflects the crippling effect it has on its victims. It is common in parts of southeast Asia, where white rice is the main food. In the United States, beriberi is primarily seen in people with chronic alcoholism. | No
10528 | Title | Description | No
10529 | NarrativeText | Beriberi puzzled medical experts for years as it rav- aged people of all ages in Asia. Doctors thought it was caused by something in food. Not until the early 1900s did scientists discover that rice bran, the outer covering that was removed to create the polished white rice pre- ferred by Asians, actually contained something that pre- vented the disease. Thiamine was the first vitamin identi- fied. In the 1920s, extracts of rice polishings were used to treat the disease. | No
10530 | NarrativeText | In adults, there are different forms of beriberi, classi- fied according to the body systems most affected. Dry beriberi involves the nervous system; wet beriberi affects the heart and circulation. Both types usually occur in the same patient, with one set of symptoms predominating. | No
10531 | NarrativeText | A less common form of cardiovascular, or wet beriberi, is known as “shoshin.” This condition involves a rapid appearance of symptoms and acute heart failure. It is highly fatal and is known to cause sudden death in young migrant laborers in Asia whose diet consists of white rice. | No
10532 | NarrativeText | Cerebral beriberi, also known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, usually occurs in chronic alcoholics and affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It can be caused by a situation that aggravates a chronic thiamine deficiency, like an alcoholic binge or severe vomiting. | No
10533 | NarrativeText | Infantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants of thi- amine-deficient mothers, who live in developing nations. | No
10534 | NarrativeText | Although severe beriberi is uncommon in the United States, less severe thiamine deficiencies do occur. About 25% of all alcoholics admitted to a hospital in the United States show some evidence of thiamine deficiency. | No
10535 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10536 | NarrativeText | Thiamine is one of the B vitamins and plays an important role in energy metabolism and tissue building. It combines with phosphate to form the coenzyme thi- amine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is essential in reac- tions that produce energy from glucose or that convert glucose to fat for storage in the tissues. When there is not enough thiamine in the diet, these basic energy functions are disturbed, leading to problems throughout the body. | No
10537 | NarrativeText | Special situations, such as an over-active metabo- lism, prolonged fever, pregnancy, and breastfeeding, can increase the body’s thiamine requirements and lead to symptoms of deficiency. Extended periods of diar- rhea or chronic liver disease can result in the body’s inability to maintain normal levels of many nutrients, including thiamine. Other persons at risk are patients with kidney failure on dialysis and those with severe digestive problems who are unable to absorb nutrients. Alcoholics are susceptible because they may substitute alcohol for food and their frequent intake of alcohol decreases the body’s ability to absorb thiamine. | No
10538 | Title | 469 | No
10539 | NarrativeText | The following systems are most affected by beriberi: * Gastrointestinal system. When the cells of the smooth muscles in the digestive system and glands do not get enough energy from glucose, they are unable to pro- duce more glucose from the normal digestion of food. There is a loss of appetite, indigestion, severe consti- pation, and a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. | No
10540 | ListItem | Nervous System. Glucose is essential for the central nervous system to function normally. Early deficiency symptoms are fatigue, irritability, and poor memory. If the deficiency continues, there is damage to the periph- eral nerves that causes loss of sensation and muscle weakness, which is called peripheral neuropathy. The legs are most affected. The toes feel numb and the feet have a burning sensation; the leg muscles become sore and the calf muscles cramp. The individual walks unsteadily and has difficulty getting up from a squatting position. Eventually, the muscles shrink (atrophy) and there is a loss of reflexes in the knees and feet; the feet may hang limp (footdrop). | No
10541 | ListItem | Cardiovascular system. There is a rapid heartbeat and sweating. Eventually the heart muscle weakens. Because the smooth muscle in the blood vessels is affected, the arteries and veins relax, causing swelling, known as edema, in the legs. | No
10542 | ListItem | * Musculoskeletal system. There is widespread muscle pain caused by the lack of TPP in the muscle tissue. | No
10543 | NarrativeText | Infants who are breastfed by a thiamine-deficient mother usually develop symptoms of deficiency between the second and fourth month of life. They are pale, restless, unable to sleep, prone to diarrhea, and have muscle wasting and edema in their arms and legs. They have a characteristic, sometimes silent, cry and develop heart failure and nerve damage. | No
10544 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10545 | NarrativeText | A physical examination will reveal many of the early symptoms of beriberi, such as fatigue, irritation, nausea, constipation, and poor memory, but the deficien- cy may be difficult to identify. Information about the individual’s diet and general health is also needed. | No
10546 | NarrativeText | There are many biochemical tests based on thiamine metabolism or the functions of TPP that can detect a thi- amine deficiency. Levels of thiamine can be measured in the blood and urine and will be reduced if there is a defi- ciency. The urine can be collected for 24 hours to mea- sure the level of thiamine excreted. Another reliable test measures the effect of TPP on red blood cell activity since all forms of beriberi affect the metabolism of red blood cells. | No
10547 | Title | 470 | No
10548 | NarrativeText | An electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures electrical activity in the brain, may be done to rule out other causes of neurologic changes. Observing improve- ments in the patient after giving thiamine supplements will also confirm the diagnosis. | No
10549 | Title | Treatment | No
10550 | NarrativeText | Treatment with thiamine reverses the deficiency in the body and relieves most of the symptoms. Severe thi- amine deficiency is treated with high doses of thiamine given by injection into a muscle (intramuscular) or in a solution that goes into a vein (intravenously) for several days. Then smaller doses can be given either by injection or in pill form until the patient recovers. Usually there are other deficiencies in the B vitamins that will also need treatment. | No
10551 | NarrativeText | The cardiovascular symptoms of wet beriberi can respond to treatment within a few hours if they are not too severe. Heart failure may require additional treatment with diuretics that help eliminate excess fluid and with heart-strengthening drugs like digitalis. | No
10552 | NarrativeText | Recovery from peripheral neuropathy and other symptoms of dry beriberi may take longer and patients frequently become discouraged. They should stay active; physical therapy will also help in recovery. | No
10553 | NarrativeText | Infantile beriberi is treated by giving thiamine to both the infant and the breast feeding mother until levels are normal. | No
10554 | NarrativeText | In Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine should be given intravenously or by injection at first because the intestinal absorption of thiamine is probably impaired and the patient is very ill. Most of the symptoms will be relieved by treatment, though there may be residual memory loss. | No
10555 | NarrativeText | Excess thiamine is excreted by the body in the urine, and negative reactions to too much thiamine are rare. Thiamine is unstable in alkali solutions, so it should not be taken with antacids or barbiturates. | No
10556 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
10557 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments for beriberi deal first with correcting the thiamine deficiency. As in conventional treatments, alternative treatments for beriberi stress a diet rich in foods that provide thiamine and other B vita- mins, such as brown rice, whole grains, raw fruits and vegetables, legumes, seeds, nuts, and yogurt. Drinking more than one glass of liquid with a meal should be avoided, since this may wash out the vitamins before they can be absorbed by the body. Thiamine should be taken daily, with the dose depending on the severity of the disease. Additional supplements of B vitamins, a multivitamin and mineral complex, and Vitamin C are also recommended. Other alternative therapies may help relieve the person’s symptoms after the thiamine defi- ciency is corrected. | No
10558 | Title | Prognosis | No
10559 | NarrativeText | Beriberi is fatal if not treated and the longer the defi- ciency exists, the sicker the person becomes. Most of the symptoms can be reversed and full recovery is possible when thiamine levels are returned to normal and main- tained with a balanced diet and vitamin supplements as needed. | No
10560 | Title | Prevention | No
10561 | NarrativeText | A balanced diet containing all essential nutrients will prevent a thiamine deficiency and the development of beriberi. People who consume large quantities of junk food like soda, pretzels, chips, candy, and high carbohy- drate foods made with unenriched flours may be defi- cient in thiamine and other vital nutrients. They may need to take vitamin supplements and should improve their diets. | No
10562 | Title | Dietary Requirements | No
10563 | NarrativeText | The body’s requirements for thiamine are tied to car- bohydrate metabolism and expressed in terms of total intake of calories. The current recommended dietary allowances (RDA) are 0.5 mg for every 1,000 calories, with a minimum daily intake of 1 mg even for those who eat fewer than 2,000 calories in a day. The RDA for chil- dren and teenagers is the same as for adults: 1.4 mg daily for males over age eleven, and 1.1 mg for females. Dur- ing pregnancy, an increase to 1.5 mg daily is needed. Because of increased energy needs and the secretion of thiamine in breast milk, breast feeding mothers need 1.5 mg every day. In infants, 0.4 mg is advised. | No
10564 | Title | Food Sources | No
10565 | NarrativeText | The best food sources of thiamine are lean pork, beef, liver, brewer’s yeast, peas and beans, whole or enriched grains, and breads. The more refined the food, as in white rice, white breads, and some cereals, the lower the thiamine. Many food products are enriched with thiamine, along with riboflavin, niacin, and iron, to prevent dietary deficiency. | No
10566 | NarrativeText | During the milling process, rice is polished and all the vitamins in the exterior coating of bran are lost. Boiling the rice before husking preserves the vitamins by distributing them throughout the kernel. Food enrichment programs have eliminated beriberi in Japan and the Phillipines | No

10595 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10596 | NarrativeText | Coughing, shortness of breath, and weight loss that begin abruptly can be a symptom of acute berylliosis. This condition is caused by beryllium air pollution that inflames the lungs making them rigid; it can affect the eyes and skin as well. People who have acute berylliosis are usually very ill. Most recover, but some die of the disease. | No

10600 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10601 | NarrativeText | Berylliosis is initially suspected if a patient with symp- toms of the disease has a history of beryllium exposure. A chest x ray shows characteristic changes in the lungs. However, since these changes can resemble those caused by other lung diseases, further testing may be necessary. | No
10602 | NarrativeText | The beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT), a blood test that can detect beryllium sensitivity (i.e. an allergic reaction to beryllium), is used to screen individuals at risk of developing berylliosis. When screening results reveal a high level of sensitivity, BeLPT is performed on cells washed from the lungs. This test is now considered the most definitive diagnostic test for berylliosis. | No
10603 | Title | Treatment | No
10604 | NarrativeText | Individuals with beryllium sensitivity or early-stage berylliosis should be transferred from tasks that involve beryllium exposure and regularly examined to determine whether the disease has progressed. | No
10605 | NarrativeText | Acute berylliosis is a serious disease that occasion- ally may be fatal. Ventilators can help patients with acute berylliosis breathe. Prompt corticosteroid therapy is required to lessen lung inflammation. | No
10606 | NarrativeText | Chronic beryllium disease is incurable. Corticos- teroid therapy is often prescribed, but it is not certain that steroids can alter the progression of the disease, and they have no effect on scarring of lung tissue. Cleansing the lungs of beryllium is a slow process, so long-term thera- py may be required. Chelation therapy is currently under investigation as a treatment for the disease. | No
10607 | Title | Prognosis | No
10608 | NarrativeText | Most patients with acute berylliosis recover fully 7-10 days after treatment begins, and the disease usually causes no after effects. | No
10609 | NarrativeText | Patients whose lungs are severely damaged by chronic berylliosis may experience fatal heart failure because of the strain placed on the heart. | No
10610 | Title | Prevention | No
10611 | NarrativeText | Eliminating exposure to beryllium is the surest way to prevent berylliosis. Screening workers who are exposed to beryllium fumes or dust or who develop an allergic reaction to these substances is an effective way to control symptoms and prevent disease progression. | No

10630 | NarrativeText | Beta,-microglobulin is a protein found on the sur- face of many cells. Testing is done primarily when evalu- ating a person for certain kinds of cancer affecting white blood cells including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and multiple myeloma or kidney disease. | No
10631 | Title | Purpose | No
10632 | NarrativeText | Beta,-microglobulin is plentiful on the surface of white blood cells. Increased production or destruction of these cells causes Beta,-microglobulin levels in the blood to increase. This increase is seen in people with cancers involving white blood cells, but it is particularly mean- ingful in people newly diagnosed with multiple myelo- ma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy (cancer) of a cer- tain kind of white blood cell, called a plasma cell. At the time of diagnosis, the Beta,-microglobulin levels reflect how advanced the disease is and the likely prognosis for that person. | No
10633 | NarrativeText | When kidney disease is suspected, comparing blood and urine levels helps identify where the kidney is dam- aged. Beta,-microglobulin normally is filtered out of the blood by the kidney’s glomeruli (a round mass of capil- lary loops leading to each kidney tubule), only to be par- tially reabsorbed back into the blood when it reaches the kidney’s tubules. In glomerular kidney disease, the glomeruli can’t filter it out of the blood, so levels increase in the blood and decrease in the urine. In tubular kidney disease, the tubules can’t reabsorb it back into the blood, so urine levels rise and blood levels fall. After a kidney transplant, increased blood levels may be an early sign of rejection. | No
10634 | NarrativeText | Increased urinary levels are found in people with kidney damage caused by high exposure to the heavy metals cadmium and mercury. Periodic testing of work- ers exposed to these metals helps to detect beginning kid- ney damage. | No
10635 | NarrativeText | Beta,-microglobulin levels also rise during infec- tion with some viruses, including cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Studies show that as HIV disease advances, beta,-microglobulin lev- els rise. | No
10636 | Title | Description | No
10637 | NarrativeText | Testing methods vary, but most involve adding the person’s serum—the yellow, liquid part of blood—or urine to one or more substances that bind to beta,- microglobulin in the serum or urine. The amount of the substance(s) bound to beta,-microglobulin is measured and the original amount of beta,-microglobulin is determined. | No

10668 | NarrativeText | Beta blockers are medicines that affect the body’s response to certain nerve impulses. This, in turn, decreases the force and rate of the heart’s contractions, which lowers blood pressure and reduces the heart’s demand for oxygen. | No
10669 | Title | Purpose | No
10670 | NarrativeText | The main use of beta blockers is to treat high blood pressure. Some also are used to relieve the type of chest pain called angina or to prevent heart attacks in people who already have had one heart attack. These drugs may also be prescribed for other conditions, such as migraine, tremors, and irregular heartbeat. In eye drop form, they are used to treat certain kinds of glaucoma. | No

10677 | NarrativeText | Do not stop taking this medicine without checking with the physician who prescribed it. Some conditions may get worse when patients stop taking beta blockers abruptly. This may also increase the risk of heart attack in some people. Because of these possible effects, it is important to keep enough medicine on hand to get through weekends, holidays, and vacations. | No
10678 | NarrativeText | Physicians may recommend that patients check their pulse before and after taking this medicine. If the pulse becomes too slow, circulation problems may result. | No
10679 | Title | Precautions | No
10680 | NarrativeText | Seeing a physician regularly while taking beta blockers is important. The physician will check to make sure the medicine is working as it should and will watch for unwanted side effects. People who have high blood pressure often feel perfectly fine. However, they should continue to see their physicians even when they feel well so that the physician can keep a close watch on their con- dition. Patients also need to keep taking their medicine even when they feel fine. | No
10681 | NarrativeText | Beta blockers will not cure high blood pressure, but will help control the condition. To avoid the serious health problems that high blood pressure can cause, patients may have to take medicine for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough. Patients with high blood pressure may also need to avoid certain foods and keep their weight under control. The health care professional who is treating the condition can offer advice on what measures may be necessary. Patients being treated for high blood pressure should not change their diets without consulting their physicians. | No
10682 | NarrativeText | Anyone taking beta blockers for high blood pressure should not take any other prescription or over-the- counter medicine without first checking with his or her physician. Some medicines may increase blood pressure. | No
10683 | NarrativeText | Anyone who is taking beta blockers should be sure to tell the health care professional in charge before hav- ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer- gency treatment. | No
10684 | NarrativeText | Some beta blockers may change the results of cer- tain medical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care profes- sional in charge. | No
10685 | NarrativeText | Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded when taking beta blockers. Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else that might be dangerous until they have found out how the drugs affect them. | No
10686 | NarrativeText | Beta blockers may increase sensitivity to cold, espe- cially in older people or people who have poor circula- tion. Anyone who takes this medicine should dress warmly in cold weather and should be careful not to be exposed to the cold for too long. | No
10687 | NarrativeText | People who usually have chest pain when they exer- cise or exert themselves may not have the pain when they are taking beta blockers. This could lead them to be more active than they should be. Anyone taking this medicine should ask his or her physician how much exercise and activity is safe. | No
10688 | NarrativeText | Older people may be unusually sensitive to the effects of beta blockers. This may increase the chance of side effects. | No

Before taking these drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of these conditions: ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to beta blockers in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to insect stings, medicines, foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub- stances. In people with allergies to medicines, foods, or insect stings, beta blockers may make the allergic reac- tions more severe and harder to treat.

10731 | NarrativeText | Bile duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma, is a malig- nant tumor of the bile ducts within the liver (intrahepatic), or leading from the liver to the small intestine (extrahepat- ic). It is a rare tumor with poor outcome for most patients. | No
10732 | Title | Description | No
10733 | NarrativeText | Bile is a substance manufactured by the liver that aids in the digestion of food. Bile ducts are channels that carry the bile from the liver to the small intestine. Like the tributaries of a river, the small bile ducts in the liver converge into two large bile ducts called the left and right hepatic ducts. These exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct. The gallbladder, which concen- trates and stores the bile, empties into the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. Finally, this large duct connects to the small intestine where the bile can help digest food. Collectively, this network of bile ducts is called the biliary tract. | No
10734 | NarrativeText | Bile duct cancer originates from the cells that line the inner surface of the bile ducts. A tumor may arise anywhere along the biliary tract, either within or outside of the liver. Bile duct tumors are typically slow-growing tumors that spread by local invasion of neighboring structures and by way of lymphatic channels. | No
10735 | NarrativeText | Bile duct cancer is an uncommon malignancy. In the United States, approximately one case arises per 100,000 people per year, but it is more common in Southeast Asia. It occurs in men only slightly more often than in women, and it is most commonly diagnosed in people in their 50s and 60s. | No

10748 | Title | Symptoms | No
10749 | NarrativeText | Jaundice is the first symptom in 90% of patients. This occurs when the bile duct tumor causes an obstruc- tion in the normal flow of bile from the liver to the small intestine. Bilirubin, a component of bile, builds up within the liver and is absorbed into the bloodstream in excess amounts. This can be detected in a blood test, but it can also manifest as yellowish discoloring of the skin and eyes. The bilirubin in the bloodstream also makes the urine appear dark. Additionally, the patient may experi- ence generalized itching due to the deposition of bile components in the skin. Normally, a portion of the bile is excreted in stool; bile actually gives stool its brown color. But when the biliary tract is obstructed by tumor, the stools may appear pale. | No

Sometimes the biliary tract can become infected, but this is normally a rare consequence of inva- sive tests. Infection causes fever, chills, and pain in the right upper portion of the abdomen. | No
10753 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10754 | NarrativeText | Certain laboratory tests of the blood may aid in the diagnosis. The most important one is the test for elevated bilirubin levels in the bloodstream. Levels of alkaline phosphatase and CA 19-9 may also be elevated. | No
10755 | NarrativeText | When symptoms, physical signs, and blood tests poinmt toward an abnormality of the biliary tract, then the next step involves radiographic tests. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT scan) are noninvasive and rapid. These tests can often detect the actual tumor as well as dilatation of the obstructed biliary tract. If these tests indicate the presence of a tumor, then cholangiogra- phy is required. This procedure involves injecting dye into the biliary tract to obtain anatomic images of the bile ducts and the tumor. The specialist that performs this test can also insert small tubes, or stents, into a partially obstructed portion of the bile duct to prevent further obstruction by growth of the tumor. This is vitally impor- tant since it may be the only intervention that is possible in certain patients. Cholangiography is an invasive test that carries a small risk of infection of the biliary tract. The objective of these radiological tests is to determine the size and location of the tumor, as well as the extent of spread to nearby structures. | No
10756 | NarrativeText | The treatment of bile duct tumors is usually not affected by the specific type of cancer cells that comprise the tumor. For this reason, some physicians forego biop- sy of the tumor. | No
10757 | Title | Treatment | No
10758 | NarrativeText | The treatment is with surgical resection (removal) of the tumor and all involved structures. Unfortunately, sometimes the cancer has already spread too far when the diagnosis is made. Thus, in the treatment of bile duct can- cer, the first question to answer is if the tumor may be safely resected by surgery with reasonable benefit to the patient. If the cancer involves certain blood vessels or has spread widely throughout the liver, then resection may not be possible. Sometimes further invasive testing is required. | No
10759 | NarrativeText | Angiography can determine if the blood vessels are involved. Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to directly assess the tumor and nearby lymph nodes without making a large incision in the abdomen. Only about 45% of bile duct cancers are ultimately resectable. | No
10760 | NarrativeText | If the tumor is resectable, and the patient is healthy enough to tolerate the operation, then the specific type of surgery performed depends on the location of the tumor. For tumors within the liver or high up in the biliary tract, resection of part of the liver may be required. Tumors in the middle portion of the biliary tract can be removed alone. Tumors of the lower end of the biliary tract may require extensive resection of part of the pancreas, small intestine, and stomach to ensure complete resection. | No
10761 | NarrativeText | Unfortunately, sometimes the cancer appears resectable by all the radiological and invasive tests, but is found to be unresectable during surgery. In this scenario, a bypass operation can relieve the biliary tract obstruction, but does not remove the tumor itself. This does not produce a cure but it can offer a better quality of life for the patient. | No
10762 | NarrativeText | Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been proven effective in the treatment of bile duct cancer. | No
10763 | Title | Prognosis | No
10764 | NarrativeText | Prognosis depends on the stage and resectability of the tumor. If the patient cannot undergo surgical resec- tion, then the survival rate is commonly less than one year. If the tumor is resected, the survival rate improves, with 20% of these patients surviving past five years. | No
10765 | Title | Clinical trials | No
10766 | NarrativeText | Studies of new treatments in patients are known as clinical trials. These trials seek to compare the standard method of care with a new method, or the trials may be try- ing to establish whether one treatment is more beneficial for certain patients than others. Sometimes, a new treat- ment that is not being offered on a wide scale may be avail- able to patients participating in clinical trials, but participat- ing in the trials may involve some risk.

10784 | NarrativeText | Biliary atresia is the most common lethal liver disease in children, occurring once every 10,000-15,000 live births. Half of all liver transplants are done for this reason. | No
10785 | NarrativeText | The normal anatomy of the bile system begins with- in the liver, where thousands of tiny bile ducts collect bile from liver cells. These ducts merge into larger and larger channels, like streams flowing into rivers, until they all pour into a single duct that empties into the duo- denum (first part of the small intestine). Between the liver and the duodenum this duct has a side channel con- nected to the gall bladder. The gall bladder stores bile and concentrates it, removing much of its water content. Then, when a meal hits the stomach, the gall bladder contracts and empties its contents. | No
10786 | NarrativeText | Bile is a mixture of waste chemicals that the liver removes from the circulation and excretes through the biliary system into the intestine. On its way out, bile assists in the digestion of certain nutrients. If bile cannot get out because the channels are absent or blocked, it backs up into the liver and eventually into the rest of the body. The major pigment in bile is a chemical called bilirubin, which is yellow. Bilirubin is a breakdown prod- uct of hemoglobin (the red chemical in blood that carries oxygen). If the body accumulates an excess of bilirubin, | No

After two weeks the normal jaundice of the newborn will not disappear, and the stools will probably be clay-colored. At this point, the condition will come to the attention of a physician. If not, the child’s abdomen will begin to swell, and the infant will get progressively more ill. Nearly all untreated chil- ren will die of liver failure within two years. | No

If the obstruction is only between the gall bladder and the intestine, it is possible to attach a piece of intestine directly to the gall bladder. More likely, the upper biliary system will also be inadequate, and the surgeon will attach a piece of intestine directly to the liver—the Kasai procedure. In its wisdom, the body will discover that the tiny bile ducts in that part of the liver are discharging their bile directly into the intestine. Bile will begin to flow in that direction, and the channels will gradually enlarge. Survival rates for the Kasai procedure are commonly 50% at five years and 15% at 10 years. Per- sistent disease in the liver gradually destroys the organ. | No

10815 | NarrativeText | Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by a loss of control over eating behaviors. The binge eater consumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a short time period, but unlike a bulimic, does not regularly engage in any inappropriate weight-reducing behaviors (for example, excessive exercise, vomiting, taking laxa- tives) following the binge episodes. | No
10816 | Title | Description | No
10817 | NarrativeText | BED typically strikes individuals sometime between adolescence and the early twenties. Because of the nature of the disorder, most BED patients are overweight or obese. Studies of weight loss programs have shown that an average of 30% of individuals enrolling in these pro- grams report binge eating behavior. | No
10818 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10819 | NarrativeText | Binge eating episodes may act as a psychological release for excessive emotional stress. Other circum- stances that may predispose an individual to BED include heredity and affective disorders, such as major depression. BED patients are also more likely to have a comorbid, or co-existing, diagnosis of impulsive behaviors (for exam- ple, compulsive buying), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, or personality disorders. | No
10820 | NarrativeText | Individuals who develop BED often come from fam- ilies who put an unnatural emphasis on the importance of food, for example, as a source of comfort in times of emotional distress. As children, BED patients may have been taught to clean their plate regardless of their appetite, or that finishing a meal made them a “good” girl or boy. Cultural attitudes towards beauty and thin- ness may also be a factor in the BED equation. | No
10821 | NarrativeText | During binge episodes, BED patients experience a definite sense of lost control over their eating. They eat quickly and to the point of discomfort even if they aren’t hungry. They typically binge alone two or more times a week, and often feel depressed and guilty once the episode has concluded. | No
10822 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10823 | NarrativeText | Binge eating disorder is usually diagnosed and treated by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. In addition to an interview with the patient, personality and behavioral inventories, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Person- ality Inventory (MMPI), may be administered as part of the assessment process. One of several clinical inventories, or scales, may also be used to assess depressive symptoms, including the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) or Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). These tests may be administered in an outpatient or hospital setting. | No
10824 | Title | Treatment | No
10825 | NarrativeText | Many BED individuals binge after long intervals of excessive dietary restraint; therapy helps normalize this pattern. The initial goal of BED treatment is to teach the patient to gain control over his eating behavior by focus- ing on eating regular meals and avoiding snacking. Cog- nitive-behavioral therapy, group therapy, or interper- sonal psychotherapy may be employed to uncover the emotional motives, distorted thinking, and behavioral patterns behind the binge eating. | No
10826 | NarrativeText | Because the prevalence of depression in BED patients is high, psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressants may also be prescribed. Once the binge eating behavior is curbed and depressive symptoms are controlled, the physical symptoms of BED can be addressed. The overweight BED patient may be placed on a moderate exercise program and a nutritionist may be consulted to educate the patient on healthy food choices and strategies for weight loss. | No

10852 | NarrativeText | Biofeedback, or applied psychophysiological feed- back, is a patient-guided treatment that teaches an indi- vidual to control muscle tension, pain, body temperature, brain waves, and other bodily functions and processes through relaxation, visualization, and other cognitive con- trol techniques. The name biofeedback refers to the bio- logical signals that are fed back, or returned, to the patient in order for the patient to develop techniques of manipu- lating them. | No
10853 | Title | Purpose | No
10854 | NarrativeText | Biofeedback has been used to successfully treat a number of disorders and their symptoms, including tem- poromandibular joint disorder (TMJ), chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Raynaud’s syndrome, epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), migraine headaches, anxiety, depression, trau- matic brain injury, and sleep disorders. | No
10855 | NarrativeText | Illnesses that may be triggered at least in part by stress are also targeted by biofeedback therapy. Certain types of headaches, high blood pressure, bruxism (teeth grinding), post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disor- ders, substance abuse, and some anxiety disorders may be treated successfully by teaching patients the ability to relax and release both muscle and mental tension. Biofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensive treatment program for some of these disorders. | No
10856 | NarrativeText | NASA has used biofeedback techniques to treat astronauts who suffer from severe space sickness, during which the autonomic nervous system is disrupted. Scien- tists at the University of Tennessee have adapted these techniques to treat individuals suffering from severe nausea and vomiting that is also rooted in autonomic nervous system dysfunction. | No
10857 | NarrativeText | Recent research also indicates that biofeedback may be a useful tool in helping patients with urinary inconti- nence regain bladder control.

10858 | Title | Description | No
10859 | Title | Origins | No
10860 | NarrativeText | In 1961, Neal Miller, an experimental psychologist, suggested that autonomic nervous system responses (for instance, heart rate, blood pressure, gastrointestinal activity, regional blood flow) could be under voluntary control. As a result of his experiments, he showed that such autonomic processes were controllable. This work led to the creation of biofeedback therapy. Willer’s work was expanded by other researchers. Thereafter, research performed in the 1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. Barry Sterman established that both cats and monkeys could be trained to control their brain wave patterns. Sterman then used his research techniques on human patients with epilepsy, where he was able to reduce seizures by 60% with the use of biofeedback techniques. Throughout the 1970s, other researchers published reports of their use of biofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, headaches, Raynaud’s syndrome, and excess stomach acid, and as a tool for teaching deep relaxation. Since the early work of Miller and Sterman, biofeedback has developed into a front-line behavioral treatment for an even wider range of disorders and symptoms. | No
10861 | NarrativeText | During biofeedback, special sensors are placed on the body. These sensors measure the bodily function that is causing the patient problem symptoms, such as heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension (EMG or elec- tromyographic feedback), brain waves (EEC or elec- troencophalographic feedback), respiration, and body temperature (thermal feedback), and translates the infor- mation into a visual and/or audible readout, such as a paper tracing, a light display, or a series of beeps. | No
10862 | NarrativeText | While the patient views the instantaneous feedback from the biofeedback monitors, he or she begins to recog- nize what thoughts, fears, and mental images influence his or her physical reactions. By monitoring this relationship between mind and body, the patient can then use these same thoughts and mental images as subtle cues, as these act as reminders to become deeply relaxed, instead of anx- ious. These reminders also work to manipulate heart beat, brain wave patterns, body temperature, and other bodily functions. This is achieved through relaxation exercises, mental imagery, and other cognitive therapy techniques. | No
10863 | NarrativeText | As the biofeedback response takes place, patients can actually see or hear the results of their efforts instant- ly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback equip- ment. Once these techniques are learned and the patient is able to recognize the state of relaxation or visualiza- tion necessary to alleviate symptoms, the biofeedback equipment itself is no longer needed. The patient then has a powerful, portable, and self-administered treatment tool to deal with problem symptoms. | No
10864 | NarrativeText | Biofeedback that specializes in reading and altering brain waves is sometimes called neurofeedback. The brain produces four distinct types of brain waves—delta, theta, alpha, and beta—that all operate at a different fre- A patient undergoing biofeedback therapy. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.) | No
10865 | NarrativeText | quency. Delta, the slowest frequency wave, is the brain wave pattern associated with sleep. Beta waves, which occur in a normal, waking state, can range from 12-35 Hz. Problems begin to develop when beta wave averages fall in the low end (underarousal) or the high end (over- arousal) of that spectrum. Underarousal might be present in conditions such as depression or attention-deficit dis- order, and overarousal may be indicative of an anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessive stress. Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizing that beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around 14 Hz. A second type of neurofeedback, alpha-theta, focus- es on developing the more relaxing alpha (8-13 Hz) and theta waves (4-9 Hz) that are usually associated with deep, meditative states, and has been used with some success in substance abuse treatment. | No
10866 | NarrativeText | Through brain wave manipulation, neurofeedback can be useful in treating a variety of disorders that are suspected or proven to impact brain wave patterns, such as epilepsy, attention-deficit disorder, migraine headaches, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury, and sleep disorders. The equipment used for neurofeed- back usually uses a monitor as an output device. The monitor displays specific patterns that the patient attempts to change by producing the appropriate type of brain wave. Or, the monitor may reward the patient for producing the appropriate brain wave by producing a positive reinforcer, or reward. For example, children may be rewarded with a series of successful moves in a dis- played video game. | No
10867 | NarrativeText | Depending on the type of biofeedback, individuals may need up to 30 sessions with a trained professional to learn the techniques required to control their symptoms on a long-term basis.

There is also some debate over the effectiveness of biofeedback in ADHD treatment, and the lack of controlled studies on that application. While many therapists, counselors, and mental health profession- als have reported great success with treating their ADHD patients with neurofeedback techniques, some critics attribute this positive therapeutic impact to a placebo effect. | No

10910 | NarrativeText | Bipolar, or manic-depressive disorder, is a mood dis- order that causes radical emotional changes and mood swings, from manic highs to depressive lows. The major- ity of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodes of mania and depression. | No
10911 | Title | Description | No
10912 | NarrativeText | In the United States alone, bipolar disorder afflicts almost two million people at an annual cost of over $45 billion, according to a report by the National Institutes of Mental Health. The average age of onset of bipolar disor- der is from adolescence through the early twenties. How- ever, because of the complexity of the disorder, a correct diagnosis can be delayed for several years or more. Ina survey of bipolar patients conducted by the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association (MDMDA), one-half of respondents reported visiting three or more professionals before receiving a correct diagnosis, and over one-third reported a wait of ten years or more before they were correctly diagnosed. | No
10913 | NarrativeText | The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the diagnostic stan- dard for mental health professionals in the United States, defines four separate categories of bipolar disorder: bipo- lar I, bipolar I, cyclothymia, and bipolar not-otherwise- specified (NOS). | No
10914 | NarrativeText | Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic episodes, the “high” of the manic-depressive cycle. A bipolar patient experiencing mania often has feelings of self-importance, elation, talkativeness, increased socia- bility, and a desire to embark on goal-oriented activities, coupled with the characteristics of irritability, impa- tience, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and a decreased need for sleep. Usually this manic period is followed by a period of depression, although a few bipolar I individu- als may not experience a major depressive episode. Mixed states, where both manic or hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms occur at the same time, also occur frequently with bipolar I patients (for example, depression with the racing thoughts of mania). Also, dys- phoric mania is common (mania characterized by anger and irritability). | No
10915 | NarrativeText | Bipolar II disorder is characterized by major depres- sive episodes alternating with episodes of hypomania, a milder form of mania. Bipolar depression may be diffi- cult to distinguish from a unipolar major depressive episode. Patients with bipolar depression tend to have extremely low energy, retarded mental and physical processes, and more profound fatigue (for example, hypersomnia; a sleep disorder marked by a need for excessive sleep or sleepiness when awake) than unipolar depressives. | No
10916 | NarrativeText | Cyclothymia refers to the cycling of hypomanic episodes with depression that does not reach major depres- sive proportions. A third of patients with cyclothymia will develop bipolar I or II disorder later in life. | No
10917 | NarrativeText | A phenomenon known as rapid cycling occurs in up to 20% of bipolar I and II patients. In rapid cycling, manic and depressive episodes must alternate frequently; at least 4 times in 12 months; to meet the diagnostic defi- nition. In some cases of “ultra-rapid cycling,” the patient may bounce between manic and depressive states several times within a 24-hour period. This condition is very hard to distinguish from mixed states. | No
10918 | NarrativeText | Bipolar NOS is a category for bipolar states that do not clearly fit into the bipolar I, I, or cyclothymia diag- noses. | No
10919 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10920 | NarrativeText | The source of bipolar disorder has not been clearly defined. Because two-thirds of bipolar patients have a family history of affective or emotional disorders, researchers have searched for a genetic link to the disor- der. Several studies have uncovered a number of possible genetic connections to the predisposition for bipolar dis- order. Another possible biological cause under investiga- tion is the presence of an excessive calcium build-up in | No
10921 | Title | 486 | No
10922 | NarrativeText | the cells of bipolar patients. Also, dopamine and other neurochemical transmitters appear to be implicated in bipolar disorder and these are under intense investigation. | No
10923 | NarrativeText | Over half of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder have a history of substance abuse. There is a high rate of association between cocaine abuse and bipolar disorder. Some studies have shown up to 30% of abusers meeting the criteria for bipolar disorder. The emotional and physi- cal highs and lows of cocaine use correspond to the manic depression of the bipolar patient, making the dis- order difficult to diagnosis. | No
10924 | NarrativeText | For some bipolar patients, manic and depressive episodes coincide with seasonal changes. Depressive episodes are typical during winter and fall, and manic episodes are more probable in the spring and summer months. | No
10925 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of bipolar depressive episodes include low energy levels, feelings of despair, difficulty concen- trating, extreme fatigue, and psychomotor retardation (slowed mental and physical capabilities). Manic episodes are characterized by feelings of euphoria, lack of inhibitions, racing thoughts, diminished need for sleep, talkativeness, risk taking, and irritability. In extreme cases, mania can induce hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms such as grandiose illusions. | No
10926 | Title | Diagnosis | No
10927 | NarrativeText | Bipolar disorder is usually diagnosed and treated by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist with medical assis- tance. In addition to an interview, several clinical inven- tories or scales may be used to assess the patient’s mental status and determine the presence of bipolar symptoms. These include the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory Ill (MCMI-II), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory II (MMPI-2), the Internal State Scale (ISS), the Self-Report Manic Inventory (SRMD, and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The tests are verbal and/or written and are administered in both hospital and outpa- tient settings. | No
10928 | NarrativeText | Psychologists and psychiatrists typically use the cri- teria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) as a guide- line for diagnosis of bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses. DSM-IV describes a manic episode as an abnormally elevated or irritable mood lasting a period of at least one week that is distinguished by at least three of the mania symptoms: inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, dis- tractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, or exces- sive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences. If the mood of the patient is irritable and not elevated, four of the symp- toms are required. | No
10929 | NarrativeText | Although many clinicians find the criteria too rigid, a hypomanic diagnosis requires a duration of at least four days with at least three of the symptoms indicated for manic episodes (four if mood is irritable and not elevat- ed). DSM-IV notes that unlike manic episodes, hypoman- ic episodes do not cause a marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, do not require hospitaliza- tion, and do not have psychotic features. In addition, because hypomanic episodes are characterized by high energy and goal directed activities and often result in a positive outcome, or are perceived in a positive manner by the patient, bipolar II disorder can go undiagnosed. | No
10930 | NarrativeText | Bipolar symptoms often present differently in chil- dren and adolescents. Manic episodes in these age groups are typically characterized by more psychotic features than in adults, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schiz- ophrenia. Children and adolescents also tend toward irri- tability and aggressiveness instead of elation. Further, symptoms tend to be chronic, or ongoing, rather than acute, or episodic. Bipolar children are easily distracted, impulsive, and hyperactive, which can lead to a misdiag- nosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Furthermore, their aggression often leads to violence, which may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder. | No
10931 | NarrativeText | Substance abuse, thyroid disease, and use of pre- scription or over-the-counter medication can mask or mimic the presence of bipolar disorder. In cases of sub- stance abuse, the patient must ordinarily undergo a peri- od of detoxification and abstinence before a mood disor- der is diagnosed and treatment begins. | No
10932 | Title | Treatment | No
10933 | NarrativeText | Treatment of bipolar disorder is usually by means of medication. A combination of mood stabilizing agents with antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants is used to regulate manic and depressive episodes. | No
10934 | NarrativeText | Mood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carba- mazepine, and valproate are prescribed to regulate the manic highs and lows of bipolar disorder: ¢ Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid, Lithonate, Lithotabs) is one of the oldest and most fre- quently prescribed drugs available for the treatment of bipolar mania and depression. Because the drug takes four to ten days to reach a therapeutic level in the blood- stream, it is sometimes prescribed in conjunction with neuroleptics and/or benzodiazepines to provide more immediate relief of a manic episode. Lithium has also been shown to be effective in regulating bipolar depres- sion, but is not recommended for mixed mania. Lithium may not be an effective long-term treatment option for rapid cyclers, who typically develop a tolerance for it, or may not respond to it. Possible side effects of the drug include weight gain, thirst, nausea, and hand tremors. Prolonged lithium use may also cause hyperthyroidism (a disease of the thryoid that is marked by heart palpita- tions, nervousness, the presence of goiter, sweating, and a wide array of other symptoms.) | No
10935 | ListItem | Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsant drug usually prescribed in conjunction with other mood stabilizing agents. The drug is often used to treat bipo- lar patients who have not responded well to lithium therapy. Blurred vision and abnormal eye movement are two possible side effects of carbamazepine therapy. As of early 1998, carbamazepine did not have an FDA- cleared indication for mania. | No
10936 | ListItem | Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproic acid, or Depakene) is one of the few drugs available that has been proven effective in treating rapid cycling bipo- lar and mixed states patients. Valproate is prescribed alone or in combination with carbamazepine and/or lithi- um. Stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea, hair loss, appetite loss, nausea, and unusual weight loss or gain are some of the common side effects of valproate. Note: val- proate is also approved for the treatment of mania. | No
10937 | NarrativeText | Because antidepressants may stimulate manic episodes in some bipolar patients, their use is typically short-term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or, less often, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) are prescribed for episodes of bipolar depression. Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat unipo- lar depression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolar patients and are, therefore, not a preferred treatment option for bipolar depression. | No
10938 | ListItem | ¢ SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil), regulate depression by regulating levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Anxiety, diarrhea, drowsiness, headache, sweating, nausea, sexual prob- lems, and insomnia are all possible side effects of SSRIs. | No
10939 | ListItem | MAOIs such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenel- zine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system. Patients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine (found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet to avoid hypotensive side effects. | No
10940 | ListItem | Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a heterocyclic antidepres- sant. The exact neurochemical mechanism of the drug is not known, but it has been effective in regulating bipolar depression in some patients. Side effects of bupropion include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor, dry mouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, and insomnia. | No
10941 | ListItem | * ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy, has a high success rate for treating both unipolar and bipolar depression, and mania. However, because of the convenience of drug treatment and the stigma sometimes attached to ECT therapy, ECT is usually employed after all phar- maceutical treatment options have been explored. ECT is given under anesthesia and patients are given a mus- cle relaxant medication to prevent convulsions. The treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses that move into the brain through electrodes on the patient’s head. Although the exact mechanisms behind the suc- cess of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed that this electrical current alters the electrochemical processes of the brain, consequently relieving depres- sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confu- sion are possible side effects immediately following an ECT procedure. Temporary memory loss has also been reported in ECT patients. In bipolar patients, ECT is often used in conjunction with drug therapy. | No
10942 | NarrativeText | Adjunct treatments are used in conjunction with a long-term pharmaceutical treatment plan: ¢ Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam (Klon- apin) and alprazolam (Xanax) are used for rapid treat- ment of manic symptoms to calm and sedate patients until mania or hypomania have waned and mood stabilizing agents can take effect. Sedation is a common effect, and clumsiness, lightheadedness, and slurred speech are other possible side effects of benzodiazepines. | No
10943 | ListItem | Neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and haloperidol (Haldol) are also used to control mania while a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproate takes effect. Because neuroleptic side effects can be severe (difficulty in speaking or swallowing, paralysis of the eyes, loss of balance control, muscle spasms, severe restlessness, stiffness of arms and legs, tremors in fingers and hands, twisting movements of body, and weakness of arms and legs), benzodiazepines are gener- ally preferred over neuroleptics. | No
10944 | ListItem | Psychotherapy and counseling. Because bipolar disorder is thought to be biological in nature, therapy is recom- mended as a companion to, but not a substitute for, phar- maceutical treatment of the disease. Psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can be a useful tool in helping patients and their families adjust to the disorder, in encouraging compliance to a medication regimen, and in reducing the risk of suicide. Also, educative counsel- ing is recommended for the patient and family. | No
10945 | NarrativeText | Calcium channel blockers (nimodipine, or Nimo- top), typically used to treat angina and hypotension, have been found effective, in a few small studies, for treating rapid cyclers. Calcium channel blockers stop the excess calcium build up in cells that is thought to be a cause of | No

10948 | NarrativeText | Clozapine (Clozaril) is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to control manic episodes in patients who have not responded to typical mood stabilizing agents. The drug has also been a useful prophylactic, or preventative treatment, in some bipolar patients. Common side effects of clozapine include tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypotension, constipation, and weight gain. Agran- ulocytosis, a potentially serious but reversible condition in which the white blood cells that typically fight infec- tion in the body are destroyed, is a possible side effect of clozapine. Patients treated with the drug should undergo weekly blood tests to monitor white blood cell counts. | No
10949 | NarrativeText | Risperidone (Risperdal) is an atypical antipsychotic medication that has been successful in controlling mania in several clinical trials when low doses were adminis- tered. The side effects of risperidone are mild compared to many other antipsychotics (constipation, coughing, diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, heartburn, increased length of sleep and dream activity, nausea, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, and weight gain). | No
10950 | NarrativeText | Lamotrigine (Lamictal, or LTG), an anticonvulsant medication, was found to alleviate manic symptoms in a 1997 trial of 75 bipolar patients. The drug was used in conjunction with divalproex (divalproate) and/or lithium. Possible side effects of lamotrigine include skin rash, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea and vomiting. | No
10951 | NarrativeText | 1TMS, or repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new and still experimental treatment for the depres- sive phase of bipolar disorder. In rTMS, a large magnet is placed on the patient’s head and magnetic fields of dif- ferent frequency are generated to stimulate the left front cortex of the brain. Unlike ECT, rT™MS requires no anes- thesia and does not induce seizures. | No
10952 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
10953 | NarrativeText | General recommendations include maintaining a calm environment, avoiding over stimulation, getting plenty of rest, regular exercise, and proper diet. Chinese herbs may soften mood swings. Biofeedback is effective in helping some patients control symptoms such as irri- tability, poor self control, racing thoughts, and sleep problems. A diet low in vanadium (a mineral found in meats and other foods) and high in vitamin C may be helpful in reducing depression. | No

10968 | NarrativeText | Drug therapies frequently need adjustment to achieve the maximum benefit for the patient. Bipolar disorder is a chronic recurrent illness in over 90% of those afflicted, and one that requires lifelong observation and treatment after diagnosis. Patients with untreated or inadequately treated bipolar disorder have a suicide rate of 15-25% and a nine- year decrease in life expectancy. With proper treatment, the life expectancy of the bipolar patient will increase by nearly seven years and work productivity increases by ten years. | No

10993 | Title | Description | No
10994 | NarrativeText | Birth defects are found in 2-3% of all newborn infants. This rate doubles in the first year, and reaches 10% by age five, as more defects become evident and can be diagnosed. Almost 20% of deaths in newborns are caused by birth defects. | No
10995 | NarrativeText | Abnormalities can occur in any major organ or part of the body. Major defects are structural abnormalities that affect the way a person looks and require medical and/or surgical treatment. Minor defects are abnormali- ties that do not cause serious health or social problems. When multiple birth defects occur together and have a similar cause, they are called syndromes. If two or more defects tend to appear together but do not share the same cause, they are called associations. | No
10996 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
10997 | NarrativeText | The specific cause of many congenital abnormalities is unknown, but several factors associated with pregnan- cy and delivery can increase the risk of birth defects. | No
10998 | NarrativeText | Any substance that can cause abnormal develop- ment of the egg in the mother’s womb is called a terato- gen. In the first two months after conception, the devel- oping organism is called an embryo; developmental stages from two months to birth are called fetal. Growth is rapid, and each body organ has a critical period in which it is especially sensitive to outside influences. About 7% of all congenital defects are caused by expo- sure to teratogens. | No

11013 | NarrativeText | A gene is a tiny, invisible unit containing informa- tion (DNA) that guides how the body forms and func- tions. Each individual inherits tens of thousands of genes from each parent, arranged on 46 chromosomes. Genes control all aspects of the body, how it works, and all its unique characteristics, including eye color and body size. Genes are influenced by chemicals and radiation, but sometimes changes in the genes are unexplained acci- dents. Each child gets half of its genes from each parent. In each pair of genes one will take precedence (domi- nant) over the other (recessive) in determining each trait, or characteristic. Birth defects caused by dominant inher- itance include a form of dwarfism called achondropla- sia; high cholesterol; Huntington’s disease, a progres- sive nervous system disorder; Marfan syndrome, which affects connective tissue; some forms of glaucoma, and polydactyly (extra fingers or toes). | No
11014 | NarrativeText | If both parents carry the same recessive gene, they have a one-in-four chance that the child will inherit the disease. Recessive diseases are severe and may lead to an early death. They include sickle cell anemia, a blood disor- der that affects blacks, and Tay-Sachs disease, which causes mental retardation in people of eastern European Jewish heritage. Two recessive disorders that affect mostly whites are: cystic fibrosis, a lung and digestive disorder, and phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder. If only one parent passes along the genes for the disorder, the nor- mal gene received from the other parent will prevent the disease, but the child will be a carrier. Having the gene is not harmful to the carrier, but there is the 25% chance of the genetic disease showing up in the child of two carriers. | No

The most common defect of this kind is Down syn- drome, a pattern of mental retardation and physical abnormalities, often including heart defects, caused by inheriting three copies of a chromosome rather than the normal pair. | No
11019 | NarrativeText | A less understood cause of birth defects results from the interaction of genes from one or both parents plus environmental influences.

11025 | NarrativeText | A serious illness in the mother, such as an underac- tive thyroid, or diabetes mellitus, in which her body can- not process sugar, can also cause birth defects in the child. An abnormal amount of amniotic fluid may indicate or cause birth defects. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that sur- rounds and protects the unborn child in the uterus. Too lit- tle of this fluid can interfere with lung or limb develop- ment. Too much amniotic fluid can accumulate if the fetus has a disorder that interferes with swallowing. | No

11031 | ListItem | Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test can be done as early as the ninth week of pregnancy to identify chromosome disorders and some genetic conditions. A thin needle is inserted through the abdomen or a slim tube is inserted through the vagina that takes a tiny tis- sue sample for testing. | No
11032 | NarrativeText | If a birth defect is suspected after a baby is born, then confirmation of the diagnosis is very important. The patient’s medical records and medical history may hold essential information. A careful physical examination and laboratory tests should be done. Special diagnostic tests can also provide genetic information in some cases. | No

11064 | NarrativeText | Birthmarks, including angiomas and vascular mal- formations, are benign (noncancerous) skin growths composed of rapidly growing or poorly formed blood vessels or lymph vessels. Found at birth (congenital) or developing later in life (acquired) anywhere on the body, they range from faint spots to dark swellings covering wide areas. | No
11065 | Title | Description | No
11066 | NarrativeText | Skin angiomas, also called vascular (pertaining to vessel) nevi (marks), are composed of blood vessels (hemangiomas) or lymph vessels (lymphangiomas), that lie beneath the skin’s surface.

11068 | NarrativeText | (60%), trunk (25%), or the arms and legs (15%). Con- genital hemangiomas, 90% of which appear at birth or within the first month of life, grow quickly, and disap- pear over time. They are found in 1-10% of full-term infants, and 25% of premature infants. About 65% are capillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks), 15% are cav- ernous (deep) hemangiomas, and the rest are mixtures. Hemangiomas are three times more common in girls. Usually, only one hemangioma is found, in 20% two are found, while fewer than 5% have three or more. Lym- phangiomas are skin bumps caused by enlarged lymph vessels anywhere on the body. | No
11069 | NarrativeText | Vascular malformations are poorly formed blood or lymph vessels that appear at birth or later in life. One type, the salmon patch (nevus simplex), a pink mark composed of dilated capillaries, is found on the back of the neck (also called a stork bite) in 40% of newborns, and on the forehead and eyelids (also called an angel’s kiss) in 20%. Stork bites are found in 70% of white and 60% of black newborns. | No
11070 | NarrativeText | Found in fewer than 1% of newborns, port-wine stains (nevus flammeus), are vascular malformations composed of dilated capillaries in the upper and lower layers of the skin of the face, neck, arms, and legs. Often permanent, these flat pink to red marks develop into dark purple bumpy areas in later life; 85% appear on only one side of the body. | No
11071 | NarrativeText | Acquired hemangiomas include spider angiomas (nevus araneus), commonly known as spider veins, and cherry angiomas (senile angiomas or Campbell de Mor- gan spots). Found around the eyes, cheekbones, arms, and legs, spider angiomas are red marks formed from dilated blood vessels. They occur during pregnancy in 70% of white women and 10% of black women, in alco- holics and liver disease patients, and in 50% of children. Cherry angiomas, dilated capillaries found mainly on the trunk, appear in the 30s, and multiply with aging. | No
11072 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
11073 | NarrativeText | There are no known causes for congenital skin angiomas; they may be related to an inherited weakness of vessel walls. Exposure to estrogen causes spider angiomas in pregnant women or those taking oral contraceptives. Spider angiomas tend to run in families, and may be asso- ciated with liver disease, sun exposure, and trauma. | No
11074 | Title | Hemangiomas | No
11075 | NarrativeText | Hemangiomas first appear as single or multiple, white or pale pink marks, ranging from 2-20 cm (average 2-5 cm) in size. Some are symptomless while others cause pain or bleeding, or interfere with normal function- ing when they are numerous, enlarged, infected, or ulcer- ated. Vision is affected by large marks on the eyelids. Spi- der and cherry angiomas are unsightly but symptomless. | No
11076 | NarrativeText | Each type of hemangioma has a characteristic appearance: * Capillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks). These round, raised marks are bright red and bumpy like a strawberry, and become white or gray when fading. | No

11082 | NarrativeText | These are faint, flat, pink stains that grow as the child grows into larger dark red or purple marks. Some are symptomless but others bleed if enlarged or injured. Disfiguring port-wine stains can cause emotional and social problems. About 5% of port-wine stains on the forehead and eyelids increase eye pressure due to involvement of the eye and surrounding nerves. Abnor- malities of the spinal cord, soft tissues, or bone may be associated with severe port-wine stains. | No

11087 | NarrativeText | Angiomas and vascular malformations are not diffi- cult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete medical history and performs a physical examination including inspection and palpation of the marks. The skin is exam- ined for discoloration, scarring, bleeding, infection, or ulceration. The type, location, size, number, and severity of the marks are recorded. The doctor may empty the mark of blood by gentle pressure. Biopsies or specialized X rays or scans of the abnormal vessels and their sur- rounding areas may be performed. Patients with port- wine stains near the eye may require skull x rays, com- puted tomography scans, and vision and central ner- vous system tests. Most insurance plans pay for diagno- sis and treatment of these conditions. | No

11093 | NarrativeText | CORTICOSTEROIDS. Daily doses of the anti-inflam- matory drugs prednisone or prednisolone are given for up to 2 months with gradual reduction of the dose. The marks begin to subside within 7-10 days, but may take up to 2 months to fully disappear. If no response is seen in 2 weeks, the drug is discontinued. Treatment may be repeat- ed. Side effects include growth retardation, increased blood pressure and blood sugar, cataracts, glandular disorders, and infection. The corticosteroids triamcinolone acetate and betamethasone sodium phosphate or acetate are inject- ed directly into the marks with a response usually achieved within a week; additional injections are given in 4-6 weeks. Side effects include tissue damage at the injection site. | No
11094 | NarrativeText | INTERFERON ALPHA-2A. This drug reduces cell growth, and is used for vascular marks that affect vision, and that are unresponsive to corticosteroids. Given in daily injections under the skin, a response rate of 50% is achieved after about 7 months. Side effects include fever, chills, muscle and joint pain, vision disorders, low white and red blood cell counts, fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, nausea, blood clotting problems, and nerve damage. | No

The FPDL, used mainly for strawberry marks and port-wine stains, penetrates to a depth of 1.8 mm and causes little scarring, while the Nd:YAG laser penetrates to a depth of 6 mm, and is used to treat deep hemangiomas. Laser surgery is not usually painful, but can be uncomfortable. Anesthetic cream is used for FPDL treatment. Treatment with the Nd:YAG laser requires local or general anesthesia. Children are usually sedated or anesthetized. Healing occurs within 2 weeks. Side effects include bruising, skin discoloration, swelling, crusting, and minor bleeding. | No
11099 | NarrativeText | SURGICAL EXCISION. Under local or general anes- thesia, the skin is cut with a surgical instrument, and vas- cular marks or their scars are removed. The cut is repaired with stitches or skin clips. | No

11152 | Title | Description | No
11153 | Title | Mammals | No
11154 | NarrativeText | DOGS. In the United States, where the dog popula- tion exceeds 50 million, dogs surpass all other mammals in the number of bites inflicted on humans. However, most dog-bite injuries are minor. A telephone survey of U.S. households conducted in 1994 led researchers to estimate that 3,737,000 dog bites not requiring medical attention occurred in the United States that year, versus 757,000 that did require medical treatment. Studies also show that most dog bites are from pets or other dogs known to the bitten person, that males are more likely than females to be bitten, and that children face a greater risk than adults. Each year, about 10-20 Americans, mostly children under 10 years of age, are killed by dogs. | No
11155 | NarrativeText | Dog bites result in an estimated 340,000 emergency- room visits annually throughout the United States. More than half of the bites seen by emergency departments occur at home. Children under 10 years old, especially boys between 5 and 9 years of age, are more likely than older people to visit an emergency room for bite treat- ment. Children under 10 years old were also much more liable to be bitten on the face, neck, and head. Nearly all of the injuries suffered by people seeking treatment in emergency rooms were of “low severity,” and most were treated and released without being admitted to hospital or sent to another facility. Many of the bites resulted from people attempting to break up fights between animals. | No
11156 | NarrativeText | CATS. Although cats are found in nearly a third of U.S. households, cat bites are far less common than dog bites. According to one study, cats inflict perhaps 400,000 harmful bites in the United States each year. The tissue damage caused by cat bites is usually limited, but they carry a high risk of infection. Whereas the infection rate for dog bite injuries is 15-20%, the infection rate for cat bites is 30-40%. A typical person who has been bitten is a young girl playing with a pet. | No
11157 | NarrativeText | HUMANS. Bites from mammals other than dogs and cats are uncommon, with one exception—human bites. There are approximately 70,000 human bites each year in the United States. Because the human mouth contains a multitude of potentially harmful microorganisms, human bites are more infectious than those of most other animals. | No

11159 | NarrativeText | Arthropods are invertebrates belonging to the phy- lum Arthropoda, which includes insects, arachnids, crus- taceans, and other subgroups. There are more than 700,000 species in all. The list of arthropods that bite or sting humans is extensive and includes lice, bedbugs, fleas, mosquitoes, black flies, ants, chiggers, ticks, cen- tipedes, scorpions, and other species. Spiders, bees, and wasps are the three kinds of arthropod that most often bite people. | No
11160 | NarrativeText | SPIDERS. In the United States, only two kinds of ven- omous spider are truly dangerous: widow spiders and brown (violin or fiddle) spiders. The black widow, which is found in every state but Alaska, is probably the most notorious widow spider. It prefers dark, dry places such as barns, garages, and outhouses, and also lives under rocks and logs. Disturbing a female black widow or its web may provoke a bite. Brown spiders also prefer sheltered places, including clothing, and may bite if disturbed. | No

Species com- mon to the United States include honeybees, bumble- bees, yellow jackets, bald-faced hornets, brown hornets, and paper wasps. Of note are also Africanized bee species, also called “killer bees” that are now found in the United States since 1990. More than fifty Americans die each year after being stung by a bee, wasp, or ant. Almost all of those deaths are the result of allergic reac- tions, and not of exposure to the venom itself. | No

11164 | NarrativeText | There are 20 species of venomous snakes in the United States. These snakes are found in every state except Maine, Alaska, and Hawaii. Each year about 8,000 Americans receive a venomous snakebite, but no more than about 15 die, mostly from rattlesnake bites. | No
11165 | NarrativeText | The venomous snakes of the United States are divid- ed into two families, the Crotalidae (pit vipers) and the Elapidae. Pit vipers, named after the small heat-sensing pit that lies between each eye and nostril, are responsible for about 99% of the venomous snakebites suffered by Americans. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths (also called water moccasins) are pit vipers. This family of snakes delivers its venom through two long, hinged fangs in the upper jaw. Some pit vipers carry a potent venom that can threaten the brain and spinal cord. The venom of others, such as the copperheads, is less harmful. | No
11166 | NarrativeText | The Elapidae family includes two kinds of ven- omous coral snakes indigenous to the southern and west- ern states. Because coral snakes are bashful creatures that come out only at night, they almost never bite humans, and are responsible for approximately 25 bites a year in the United States. Coral snakes also have short fangs and a small mouth, which lowers the risk of a bite actually forcing venom into a person’s body. However, their venom is quite poisonous. | No

11171 | NarrativeText | DOGS. A typical dog bite results in a laceration, tear, puncture, or crush injury. Bites from large, powerful dogs may even cause fractures and dangerous internal injuries. Also, dogs trained to attack may bite repeatedly during a single episode. Infected bites usually cause pain, cellulitis (inflammation of the connective tissues), and a | No

11173 | NarrativeText | pus-filled discharge at the wound site within 8-24 hours. Most infections are confined to the wound site, but many of the microorganisms in the mouths of dogs can cause systemic and possibly life-threatening infections. Exam- ples are bacteremia and meningitis, especially severe in people diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syn- drome (AIDS) or other health condition that increases their susceptibility to infection. Rabies is rare among pet dogs in the United States, most of which have been vacci- nated against the disease. Tetanus is also rare but can be transmitted by a dog bite if the victim is not immunized. | No
11174 | NarrativeText | CATS. The mouths of cats and dogs contain many of the same microorganisms. Cat scratches and bites are also capable of transmitting the Bartonella henselae bac- terium, which can lead to cat-scratch disease, an unpleasant but usually not life-threatening illness. | No
11175 | NarrativeText | Cat bites are mostly found on the arms and hands. Sharp cat teeth typically leave behind a deep puncture wound that can reach muscles, tendons, and bones, which are vulnerable to infection because of their comparatively poor blood supply. This is why cat bites are much more likely to become infected than dog bites. Also, people are less inclined to view cat bites as dangerous requiring immediate attention; the risk that infection has set in by the time a medical professional is consulted is thus greater. | No
11176 | NarrativeText | HUMANS. Humans bites result from fights, sexual activity, medical and dental treatment, and seizures. Bites also raise the possibility of spousal or child abuse. Chil- dren often bite other children, but those bites are hardly ever severe. Human bites are capable of transmitting a wide range of dangerous diseases, including hepatitis B, syphilis, and tuberculosis. | No
11177 | NarrativeText | Human bites fall into two categories: occlusional (true) bites and clenched-fist injuries. The former present a lower risk of infection. The latter, which are very infec- tious and can permanently damage the hand, usually result from a fist hitting teeth during a fight. People often wait before seeking treatment for a clenched-fist injury, with the result that about half of such injuries are infect- ed by the time they are seen by a medical professional. | No
11178 | Title | Arthropods | No
11179 | NarrativeText | SPIDERS. As a rule, people rarely see a black widow bite, nor do they feel the bite as it occurs. The first (and possibly only) evidence that a person has been bitten may be a mild swelling of the injured area and two red punc- ture marks. Within a short time, however, some victims begin to experience severe muscle cramps and rigidity of the abdominal muscles. Other possible symptoms include excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and vertigo as well as breathing, vision, and speech problems. | No
11180 | NarrativeText | A brown spider’s bite can lead to necrotic arachni- dism, in which the tissue in an area of up to several inch- es around the bite becomes necrotic (dies), producing an open sore that can take months or years to disappear. In most cases, however, the bite simply produces a hard, painful, itchy, and discolored area that heals without treatment in 2-3 days. The bite may also be accompanied by a fever, chills, edema (an accumulation of excess tis- sue fluid), nausea and vomiting, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, and a rash. | No
11181 | NarrativeText | BEES AND WASPS. The familiar symptoms of bee and wasp stings include pain, redness, swelling, and itch- iness in the area of the sting. Multiple stings can have much more severe consequences, such as anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs in hypersen- sitive persons. | No
11182 | Title | Snakes | No
11183 | NarrativeText | Venomous pit viper bites usually begin to swell within 10 minutes and sometimes are painful. Other symptoms include skin blisters and discoloration, weak- ness, sweating, nausea, faintness, dizziness, bruising, and tender lymph nodes. Severe poisoning can also lead to tingling in the scalp, fingers, and toes, muscle contrac- tions, an elevated heart rate, rapid breathing, large drops in body temperature and blood pressure, vomiting of blood, and coma. | No
11184 | NarrativeText | Many pit viper and coral snake bites (20-60%) fail to poison (envenomate) their victim, or introduce only a small amount of venom into the victim’s body. The wounds, however, can still become infected by the harm- ful microorganisms that snakes carry in their mouths. | No
11185 | NarrativeText | Coral snake bites are painful but may be hard to see. One to seven hours after the bite, a bitten person begins to experience the effects of the venom, which include tingling at the wound site, weakness, nausea, vomiting, excessive salivation, and irrational behavior. Major nerves of the body can become paralyzed for 6-14 days, causing double vision, difficulty swallowing and speaking, respiratory failure, and other problems. Six to eight weeks may be needed before normal muscular strength is regained. | No

11187 | NarrativeText | JELLYFISH. Jellyfish venom is delivered by barbs called nematocysts, which are located on the creature’s tentacles and penetrate the skin of people who brush up against them. Instantly painful and itchy red lesions usu- ally result. The pain can continue up to 48 hours. Severe cases may lead to skin necrosis, muscle spasms and cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, exces- An insect bite caused this person’s lower lip to swell. (Cus- tom Medical Stock Photo.

11189 | NarrativeText | STINGRAYS. Tail spines are the delivery mechanism for stingray venom. Deep puncture wounds result that can cause an infection if pieces of spine become embedded in the wound. A typical stingray injury scenario involves a person who inadvertently steps on a resting stingray and is lashed in the ankle by its tail. Stingray venom produces immediate, excruciating pain that lasts several hours. Sometimes the victim suffers a severe reaction, including vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage (bleeding), a drop in blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia (disordered heart beat). | No
11190 | Title | Diagnosis | No
11191 | Title | Mammals | No
11192 | NarrativeText | DOGS. Gathering information on the circumstances of a dog attack is a crucial part of treatment. Medical professionals need to know when the attack occurred (the chances of infection increase dramatically if the wound has been left untreated for more than eight hours) and what led to the attack (unprovoked attacks are more like- ly to be associated with rabies). A person’s general health must also be assessed, including the tetanus immuniza- tion history if any, as well as information concerning possible allergies to medication and pre-existing health problems that may increase the risk of infection. | No
11193 | NarrativeText | A physical examination requires careful scrutiny of the wound, with special attention to possible bone, joint, ligament, muscle, tendon, nerve, or blood-vessel damage caused by deep punctures or severe crush injuries. Seri- ous hand injuries should be evaluated by a specialized surgeon. Most of the time, laboratory tests for identifying the microorganisms in bite wounds are performed if infection is present. X rays and other diagnostic proce- dures may also be necessary. | No

11197 | NarrativeText | HUMANS. Testing the blood of a person who has been bitten for immunity to hepatitis B and other dis- eases is always necessary after a human bite. Ideally, the biter should be tested as well for the presence of trans- missible disease. Clenched-fist injuries often require evaluation by a hand surgeon or orthopedist. Because many people will deny having been in a fight, medical professionals usually consider lacerations over the fourth and fifth knuckles—the typical result of a clenched-fist injury—to be evidence of a bite wound. Medical profes- sionals also look for indications of spousal or child abuse when evaluating human bites. | No

11200 | Title | Snakes | No
11201 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis relies on a physical examination of the victim, information about the circumstances of the bite, and a look at the snake itself (if it can safely be killed and brought in for identification). Blood tests and urinalysis supply important data on the victim’s condition. Chest x- rays and electrocardiography (a procedure for measur- ing heart activity) may also be necessary. | No

11205 | Title | 500 | No
11206 | NarrativeText | applying pressure to the injured area with a clean towel to stop the bleeding. The next step is to apply antibiotic ointment and a sterile bandage to the wound. To reduce swelling and fend off infection, ice should be applied and the injured area kept elevated above the level of the heart. The wound should be cleaned and covered with ointment twice a day until it heals. | No
11207 | NarrativeText | Any dog bite that does not stop bleeding after 15 minutes of pressure must be seen by a medical profes- sional. The same is true for bites that are deep or gaping; for bites to the head, hands, or feet; and for bites that may have broken a bone, damaged nerves, or caused a major injury of another kind. Bite victims must also watch for infection. A fever is one sign of infection, as are redness, swelling, warmth, increased tenderness, and pus at the wound site. Diabetics, people with AIDS or cancer, individuals who have not had a tetanus shot in five years, and anyone else who has a medical problem that can increase susceptibility to infection should seek medical treatment no matter how minor the bite appears. | No
11208 | NarrativeText | Medical treatment of dog bites involves washing the wound with an anti-infective solution. Removal of dead and damaged tissue (under local, regional, or general anesthetic) may be required after the wound has been washed, and any person whose tetanus shots are not up to date should receive a booster injection. Some wounds are left open and allowed to heal on their own, while others require stitches (stitching may be delayed a few days if infection is a concern). Many emergency departments prescribe antibiotics for all people with dog bites, but some researchers suggest that antibiotics are usually unnecessary and should be limited to those whose injuries or other health problems make them likely candi- dates for infection. A follow-up visit after one or two days is generally required for anyone who has received bite treatment. | No
11209 | NarrativeText | CATS. Because of the high risk of infection, people who are bitten by a cat should always see a doctor. Cat scratches do not require professional medical treatment unless the wound appears infected or the scratched per- son has a weakened immune system. | No
11210 | NarrativeText | Medical treatment for cat bites generally follows the procedures used for dog bites. Experts advise, however, that cat-bite wounds should always be left open to pre- vent infection. Persons who have been bitten by cats gen- erally receive antibiotics as a preventive measure. | No
11211 | NarrativeText | HUMANS. Human bites should always be examined by a doctor. Such bites are usually treated with antibi- otics and left open because of the high risk of infection.

11216 | NarrativeText | SPIDERS. No spider bite should be ignored. The anti- dote for severe widow spider bites is a substance called antivenin, which contains antibodies taken from the blood serum of horses injected with spider venom. Doc- tors exercise caution in using antivenin, however, because it can trigger anaphylactic shock, a potentially deadly (though treatable) allergic reaction, and serum sickness, an inflammatory response that can give rise to joint pain, a fever, rashes, and other unpleasant, though rarely serious, consequences. | No
11217 | NarrativeText | Persons who have been stung and experience an allergic reaction, or who are at risk due to their medical history, require immediate medical attention. The danger signs, which usually begin 10 minutes after an individual is stung (though possibly not for several hours), include nausea, faintness, chest pain, abdominal cramps, diar- thea, and difficulty swallowing or breathing. | No
11218 | Title | Snakes | No
11219 | NarrativeText | An antivenin for brown spider bites exists as well, but it is not yet available in the United States. The drug dapsone, used to treat leprosy, can sometimes stop the tissue death associated with a brown spider bite. Necrot- ic areas may need debridement (removal of dead and damaged tissue) and skin grafts. Pain medications, anti- histamines, antibiotics, and tetanus shots are a few of the other treatments that are sometimes necessary after a bite from a brown spider or widow spider. | No
11220 | NarrativeText | Although most snakes are not venomous, any snakebite should immediately be examined at a hospital. While waiting for emergency help to arrive, the victim should wash the wound site with soap and water, and then keep the injured area still and at a level lower than the heart. Ice should never be used on the wound site nor should attempts be made to suck out the venom. Making a cut at the wound site is also dangerous. It is important to stay calm and wait for emergency medical aid if it can arrive quickly. Otherwise, the victim should proceed directly to a hospital. | No
11221 | NarrativeText | BEES AND WASPS. Most stings can be treated at home. A stinger that is stuck in the skin can be scraped off with a blade, fingernail, credit card, or piece of paper (using tweezers may push more venom out of the venom sac and into the wound). The area should be cleaned and When the victim arrives at a hospital, the medical staff must determine whether the bite was inflicted by a venomous snake and, if so, whether envenomation occurred and how much venom the person has received. | No

The risk of a dog bite injury can be reduced by avoiding sick or stray dogs, staying away from dog- fights (people often get bitten when they try to separate the animals), and not behaving in ways that might provoke or upset dogs, such as wrestling with them or bothering them while they are sleeping, eating, or looking after their pup- pies. Special precautions need to be taken around infants and young children, who must never be left alone with a dog. Pit bulls, rottweilers, and German shepherds (respon- sible for nearly half of all fatal dog attacks in the United States in 1997-2000) are potentially dangerous pets in households where children live or visit. For all breeds of dog, obedience training as well as spaying or neutering lessen the chances of aggressive behavior. | No

11304 | NarrativeText | Black lung disease is the common name for coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) or anthracosis, a lung disease of older workers in the coal industry, caused by inhalation, over many years, of small amounts of coal dust. | No
11305 | Title | Description | No
11306 | NarrativeText | The risk of having black lung disease is directly related to the amount of dust inhaled over the years; the disease typically affects workers over age 50. Its com- mon name comes from the fact that the inhalation of heavy deposits of coal dust makes miners lungs look black instead of a healthy pink. Although people who live in cities often have some black deposits in their lungs from polluted air, coal miners have much more extensive deposits. | No

11308 | NarrativeText | In the years since the federal government has regu- ated dust levels in coal mines, the number of cases of black lung disease has fallen sharply. Since the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, average dust evels have fallen from 8.0 mg. per cubic meter to the current standard of 2.0 mg. per cubic meter. The 1969 aw also set up a black lung disability benefits program to compensate coal miners who have been disabled by on-the-job dust exposure. | No
11309 | NarrativeText | Despite the technology available to control the hazard, however, miners still run the risk of develop- ing this lung disease. The risk is much lower today, however; fewer than 10% of coal miners have any x ray evidence of coal dust deposits. When there is such evidence, it often shows up as only small black spots ess than 0.4 in (1 cm). in diameter, and may have been caused by smoking rather than coal dust. This condition is called “simple CWP” and does not lead to symptoms or disability. | No
11310 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
11311 | NarrativeText | Since the particles of fine coal dust, which a miner breathes when he is in the mines, cannot be destroyed within the lungs or removed from them, builds up. Even- tually, this build-up causes thickening and scarring, making the lungs less efficient in supplying oxygen to the blood. | No
11312 | NarrativeText | The primary symptom of the disease is shortness of breath, which gradually gets worse as the disease pro- gresses. In severe cases, the patient may develop cor pul- monale, an enlargement and strain of the right side of the heart caused by chronic lung disease. This may eventual- ly cause right-sided heart failure. | No

11319 | NarrativeText | Some patients develop emphysema (a disease in which the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged, leading to shortness of breath, and respiratory and heart failure) as a complication of black lung disease. Others develop a severe type of black lung disease called pro- gressive massive fibrosis, in which damage continues in the upper parts of the lungs even after exposure to the dust has ended. Scientists aren’t sure what causes this serious complication. Some think that it may be due to the breathing of a mixture of coal and silica dust that is found in certain mines. Silica is far more likely to lead to scarring than coal dust alone. | No
11320 | Title | Diagnosis | No
11321 | NarrativeText | Black lung disease can be diagnosed by checking a patient’s history for exposure to coal dust, followed by a chest x-ray to discover if the characteristic spots in the lungs caused by coal dust are present. A pulmonary function test may aid in diagnosis. | No

11338 | NarrativeText | Bladder cancer is a disease in which the cells lining the urinary bladder lose the ability to regulate their growth and start dividing uncontrollably. This abnormal growth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor. | No

11340 | NarrativeText | Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that in 1998, approximately 55,000 new cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed, and it will cause at least 12,500 deaths. The disease is three times more com- mon among men than women, and the incidence is also higher in caucasians. | No
11341 | NarrativeText | The urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that stores urine from the kidneys until it is excreted out of the body. Two tubes called the ureters bring the urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The urethra carries the urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. | No

11346 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
11347 | NarrativeText | Although the exact cause of bladder cancer is not known, smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to get the disease. Hence, smoking is considered the greatest risk factor for bladder cancer. Workers who are exposed to certain chemicals that are used in the dye industry and in the rubber, leather, textile, and paint industries are believed to be at a higher risk for bladder cancer. The dis- ease is also three times more common in men than in women; caucasians also are at an increased risk. The risk of bladder cancer increases with age. Most cases are found in people who are 50-70 years old. | No
11348 | NarrativeText | Frequent urinary infections, kidney and bladder stones, and other conditions that cause long-term irrita- tion to the bladder may increase the risk of getting blad- der cancer. A past history of tumors in the bladder could also increase one’s risk of getting other tumors. | No

When detected early and treated appropriately, patients have a very good chance of being cured completely. | No
11350 | Title | Diagnosis | No
11351 | NarrativeText | If a doctor has any reason to suspect bladder cancer, he may use several tests to find out if the disease is present. As a first step, a complete medical history will be taken to check for any risk factors. A thorough physical examina- tion will be conducted to assess all the signs and symp- toms. Laboratory testing of a urine sample will help to rule out the presence of a bacterial infection. In a urine cytology test, the urine is examined under a microscope to look for any abnormal or cancerous cells. A catheter (tube) can be advanced into the bladder through the urethra, and a salt solution is passed through it to wash the bladder. The solu- tion can then be collected and examined under a micro- scope to check for the presence of any cancerous cells. | No
11352 | NarrativeText | One of the first warning signals of bladder cancer is blood in the urine. Sometimes, there is enough blood in the urine to change the color of the urine to a yellow-red or a dark red. At other times, the color of the urine appears nor- mal but chemical testing of the urine reveals the presence of blood cells. A change in bladder habits such as painful A test known as the intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is an x-ray examination that is done after a dye is injected into the blood stream through a vein in the arm. The dye travels through the blood stream and then reaches the kidneys to be excreted. It clearly outlines the kidneys, | No

11354 | NarrativeText | ureters, bladder, and urethra. Multiple x rays are taken to detect any abnormality in the lining of these organs. | No
11355 | NarrativeText | The physician may use a procedure known as a cys- toscopy to view the inside of the bladder. A thin hollow lighted tube is introduced into the bladder through the urethra. If any suspicious looking masses are seen, a small piece of the tissue can be removed from it using a pair of biopsy forceps. The tissue is then examined microscopically to verify if cancer is present, and if so, to identify the type of cancer. | No
11356 | NarrativeText | If cancer is detected and there is evidence to indicate that it has metastasized (spread) to distant sites in the body, imaging tests such as chest x rays, computed tomography scans (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done to determine which organs are affected. Bladder cancer generally tends to spread to the lungs, liver, and bone. | No
11357 | Title | Treatment | No
11358 | NarrativeText | Treatment for bladder cancer depends on the stage of the tumor. The patient’s medical history, overall health status, and personal preferences are also taken into account when deciding on an appropriate treatment plan. The three standard modes of treatment that are available for bladder cancer are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In addition, newer treatment methods such as photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy are also being investigated in clinical trials. | No
11359 | NarrativeText | Surgery is considered an option only when the disease is in its early stages. If the tumor is localized to a small area and has not spread to the inner layers of the bladder, then the surgery is done without cutting open the abdomen. A cytoscope is introduced into the bladder through the ure- thra, and the tumor is removed through it. This procedure is called a transurethral resection (TUR). Passing a high-ener- gy laser beam through the cytoscope and burning the can- cer may treat any remaining cancer. This procedure is known as electrofulguration. If the cancer has invaded the walls of the bladder, surgery will be done through an inci- sion in the abdomen. Cancer that is not very large can be removed by partial cystectomy, a procedure where a part of the bladder is removed. If the cancer is large or is present in more than one area of the bladder, a radical cystectomy is done. In this operation, besides the entire bladder, the adjoining organs may also be removed. In men, the prostate is removed, while in women, the uterus, ovaries, and fal- lopian tubes are removed. | No
11360 | NarrativeText | If the entire urinary bladder is removed, then an alter- nate storage place must be created for the urine to be stored before it is excreted out of the body. To do this, a piece of intestine is converted into a small bag and attached to the ureters. This is then connected to an open- ing (stoma) that is made in the abdominal wall. The proce- dure is called a urostomy. In some urostomy procedures, the urine from the intestinal sac is routed into a bag that is placed over the stoma in the abdominal wall. The bag is hidden by the clothing and has to be emptied occasionally by the patient. In a different procedure, the urine is collect- ed in the intestinal sac, but there is no bag on the outside of the abdomen. The intestinal sac has to be emptied by the patient, by placing a drainage tube through the stoma. | No
11361 | NarrativeText | Radiation therapy that uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells is generally used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells that may not have been removed during surgery. If the tumor is in a location that makes surgery difficult, or if it is large, radiation may be used before surgery to shrink the tumor. In cases of advanced bladder cancer, radiation therapy is used to ease the symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or blockage. Radiation can be delivered by external beam radiation where a source of radiation that is outside the body focuses the radiation on the area of the tumor. Occasionally, a small pellet of radioactive material may be placed directly into the cancer. This is known as interstitial radiation therapy. | No
11362 | NarrativeText | Chemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells that may have migrated to distant sites. The drugs are introduced into the bloodstream by injecting them into a vein in the arm or taking them orally in pill form. Generally a combination of drugs is more effective than any single drug in treating bladder cancer. Chemotherapy may be given following surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. It may also be given even when no remaining cancer cells can be seen. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs, including thiotepa, doxorubicin, and mit- omycin, may also be instilled directly into the bladder (intravesicular chemotherapy) to treat superficial tumors. | No
11363 | NarrativeText | Immunotherapy or biological therapy, uses the body’s own immune cells to fight the disease. To treat superficial bladder cancer, bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may be instilled directly into the bladder. BCG is a weakened (attenuated) strain of the tuberculosis bacil- lus that stimulates the body’s immune system to fight the cancer. This therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling superficial bladder cancer. | No
11364 | NarrativeText | Photodynamic treatment is a novel mode of treat- ment that uses special chemicals and light to kill the can- cerous cells.

11411 | NarrativeText | While the exact causes of the formation of bladder stones are not completely understood, bladder stones usually occur because of urinary tract infection (UTI), obstruction of the urinary tract, enlargement of the prostate gland in men, or the presence of foreign bodies in the urinary tract. Diet and the amount of fluid intake also appear to be important factors in the development of bladder stones. | No

11418 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of bladder stones is usually made after a physical examination, which may include a rectal exami- nation to check for enlargement of the prostate gland. Urine tests are then used to determine if there is blood or indications of an UTI in the urine. If bladder stones are sus- pected, bladder or pelvic x rays may be ordered. Stones that are large enough to cause problems with urinary function are almost always detectable by x ray. | No

11420 | NarrativeText | Many bladder stones can be passed out of the body in the urine. People with small bladder stones will be asked to increase their fluid intakes to at least six to eight eight-ounce glasses of water per day to increase urinary output. If the stones do not pass after two weeks, or if the patient’s symptoms become worse, further medical treat- ment may be required. | No
11421 | NarrativeText | A large bladder stone, or small stone that the patient cannot pass in the urine, may be broken up into smaller stones using ultrasound (shock waves). These smaller stones may then pass in the urine. Stones that cannot be broken into pieces by these methods, or that the patient cannot pass, may have to be surgically removed. | No

11423 | NarrativeText | Traditional herbal remedies for bladder stones include celery seed and horsetail. Also, because incomplete blad- der emptying may cause bladder stones, many patients may benefit from methods and remedies aimed at improv- ing overall bladder function. These include Kegel exercis- es, which are used to strengthen the muscles involved in urination; herbal supplements (cornsilk, hydrangea, juniper berries, parsley, and uva ursi) used to increase urine flow and flush out sediment from the bladder; and, the consumption of cranberry juice and/or fresh, unsweet- ened, lemon juice. Cranberry juice helps to control urinary tract infection and contains a chemical that coats the walls of the bladder, making them more resistant to infection. Lemon juice helps to flush out the urinary system. | No
11424 | Title | Prognosis | No
11425 | NarrativeText | Most bladder stones can be, and are, passed out of the body in the urine without any permanent damage to the bladder or the rest of the urinary tract. However, most bladder stones arise from an underlying medical condi- tion. Therefore, if this medical condition is not corrected approximately half of all patients will experience a recur- rence of bladder stones within five years. | No

11456 | NarrativeText | Bladder training may be prescribed and implement- ed by a general physician, urologist, or urogynecologist. A urination schedule is created for the patient. The schedule typically starts out with fairly short intervals between bathroom breaks (e.g., an hour). As soon as the patient is able to consistently remain continent for sever- al days at a certain toileting time interval, the time span is increased. Bladder training continues until the patient regularly achieves continence at a time interval he/she feels comfortable with. | No

11458 | NarrativeText | A complete evaluation to determine the cause of uri- nary incontinence is critical to proper treatment. A thor- ough medical history and physical examination should be performed on patients considering bladder training. Diagnostic testing may include x rays, ultrasound, urine tests, and a physical examination of the pelvis. It may include a series of exams called urodynamic testing that measure bladder pressure and capacity and the urinary flow.

11478 | NarrativeText | Blastomycosis is an infection caused by inhaling microscopic particles (spores) produced by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. Blastomycosis may be limited to the lungs or also involve the skin and bones. In its most severe form, the infection can spread throughout the body and involve many organ systems (systemic). | No
11479 | Title | Description | No
11480 | NarrativeText | Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blas- tomyces dermatitidis. Although primarily an airborne disease, farmers and gardeners may become infected from contact with spores in the soil through cuts and scrapes. The fungus that causes the disease is found in moist soil and wood in the southeastern United States, the Mississippi River valley, southern Canada, and Cen- tral America. Blastomycosis is also called Gilchrist’s dis- ease, Chicago disease, or North American blastomycosis. Another South and Central American disease, paracoc- cidioidomycosis, is sometimes called South American blastomycosis, but despite the similar name, this disease is substantially different from North American blastomy- cosis. Canine blastomycosis, a common dog disease, is caused by the same fungus that infects hamans. Howev- er, people do not get this disease from their dogs except only very rarely through dog bites. | No
11481 | NarrativeText | Blastomycosis is a rare disease infecting only about 4 in every 100,000 people. It is at least six times more common in men than in women and tends to more often infect children and individuals in the 30-50 year old age group. People who have diabetes mellitus or who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system (immuno- compromised) are more likely to develop blastomycosis. Although people with AIDS can get blastomycosis because of their weakened immune system, blastomyco- sis has not been one of the more common fungal infec- tions associated with AIDS. | No
11482 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
11483 | NarrativeText | Once inhaled, the spores of B. dermatitidis can lodge in the lungs and cause a localized inflammation. This is known as primary pulmonary blastomycosis. The disease does not spread from one person to another. In the early stages, symptoms may include a dry cough, fever, heavy sweating, fatigue, and a general feeling of ill health. In approximately 25% of blastomycosis cases, only the lungs are affected. As the disease progresses, small lesions form in the lungs causing the air sacs deep within the lungs (alveoli) to break down and form small cavities. | No
11484 | NarrativeText | In another 35%, the disease involves both the lungs and the skin. Bumps develop on the skin, gradually becoming small, white, crusted blisters filled with pus. The blisters break open, creating abscesses that do not heal. Approximately 19% of infected people have skin sores without infection in the lungs. | No
11485 | NarrativeText | The remaining approximately 20% of the infected population has blastomycosis that has spread or dissemi- nated to other systems of the body. Symptoms may include pain and lesions on one or more bones, the male genitalia, and/or parts of the central nervous system. The liver, spleen, lymph nodes, heart, adrenal glands, and digestive system may also be infected. | No
11486 | Title | Diagnosis | No
11487 | NarrativeText | A positive diagnosis of blastomycosis is made when the fungus B. dermatitidis is identified by direct micro- scopic examination of body fluids such as sputum and prostate fluid or in tissue samples (biopsies) from the Blastomycosis is usually attributed to contact with yeast-like fungi. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.) | No
11488 | NarrativeText | lung or skin. Another way to diagnose blastomycosis is to culture and isolate the fungus from a sample of spu- tum. Chest x rays are used to assess lung damage, but alone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of blastomy- cosis because any damage caused by other diseases, such as by pneumonia or tuberculosis, may appear look on the x ray. Because its symptoms vary widely, blastomy- cosis is often misdiagnosed. | No
11489 | Title | Treatment | No
11490 | NarrativeText | Blastomycosis must be treated or it will gradually lead to death. Treatment with the fungicidal drug keto- conazole (Nizoral) taken orally is effective in about 75% of patients. Amphotericin B (Fungizone) given intra- venously is also very effective, but it has more toxic side effects than ketoconazole. Treatment with amphotericin B usually requires hospitalization, and the patient may also receive other drugs to minimize the its side effects. | No
11491 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
11492 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatment for fungal infections focuses on creating an internal environment where the fungus cannot survive. This is accomplished by eating a diet low in dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice, and foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple- mented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncooked and unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitamins C, E, A-plus, and B complex may also be useful. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium will replenish the good bacteria in the intestines. Some antifungal herbs, like garlic (Allium sativum), can be consumed in relatively large doses and for an extended period of time in order to increase effectiveness.

11506 | Title | Prevention | No
11507 | NarrativeText | Because the fungus that causes blastomycosis is air- borne and microscopic, the only form of prevention is to avoid visiting areas where it is found in the soil. For many people this is impractical. Since the disease is rare, people who maintain general good health do not need to worry much about infection. | No

11518 | NarrativeText | Bleeding time is a crude test of hemostasis (the arrest or stopping of bleeding). It indicates how well platelets interact with blood vessel walls to form blood clots. | No
11519 | Title | Purpose | No
11520 | NarrativeText | Bleeding time is used most often to detect qualitative defects of platelets, such as Von Willebrand’s disease. The test helps identify people who have defects in their platelet function. This is the ability of blood to clot fol- lowing a wound or trauma. Normally, platelets interact with the walls of blood vessels to cause a blood clot. There are many factors in the clotting mechanism, and they are initiated by platelets. The bleeding time test is usually used on patients who have a history of prolonged bleeding after cuts, or who have a family history of bleed- ing disorders. Also, the bleeding time test is sometimes performed as a preoperative test to determine a patient’s likely bleeding response during and after surgery. Howev- er, in patients with no history of bleeding problems, or who are not taking anti-inflammatory drugs, the bleeding time test is not usually necessary. | No
11521 | Title | Precautions | No
11522 | NarrativeText | Before administering the test, patients should be questioned about what medications they may be taking. Some medications will adversely affect the results of the bleeding time test. These medications include anticoagu- lants, diuretics, anticancer drugs, sulfonamides, thi- azide, aspirin and aspirin-containing preparations, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The test may also be affected by anemia (a deficiency in red blood cells). Since the taking of aspirin or related drugs are the most common cause of prolonged bleeding time, no aspirin should be taken two weeks prior to the test. | No
11523 | Title | Description | No
11524 | NarrativeText | There are four methods to perform the bleeding test. The Ivy method is the traditional format for this test. In the Ivy method, a blood pressure cuff is placed on the upper arm and inflated to 40 mM Hg. A lancet or scalpel blade is used to make a stab wound on the underside of the forearm. An automatic, spring-loaded blade device is most commonly used to make a stan- dard-sized cut. The area stabbed is selected so that no superficial or visible veins are cut. These veins, because of their size, may have longer bleeding times, especial- ly in people with bleeding defects. The time from when the stab wound is made until all bleeding has stopped is measured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30 sec- onds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw off the blood. The test is finished when bleeding has stopped completely. | No
11525 | NarrativeText | The three other methods of performing the bleeding test are the template, modified template, and Duke methods. The template and modified template methods are variations of the Ivy method. A blood pressure cuff is used and the skin on the forearm prepared as in the Ivy method. A template is placed over the area to be stabbed and two incisions are made in the forearm using the template as a location guide. The main difference between the template and the modified method is the length of the cut made. | No
11526 | NarrativeText | For the Duke method, a nick is made in an ear lobe or a fingertip is pricked to cause bleeding. As in the Ivy method, the test is timed from the start of bleeding until bleeding is completely stopped. The disadvantage to the Duke method is that the pressure on the blood veins in the stab area is not constant and the results achieved are less reliable. The advantage to the Duke method is that no scar remains after the test. The other methods may result in a tiny, hairline scar where the wound was made. However, this is largely a cosmetic concern. | No
11527 | Title | Preparation | No
11528 | NarrativeText | There is no special preparation required of the patient for this test. The area to be stabbed should be wiped clean with an alcohol pad. The alcohol should be left on the skin long enough for it to kill bacteria at the wound site. The alcohol must be removed before stab- bing the arm because alcohol will adversely affect the tests results by inhibiting clotting. | No
11529 | Title | Aftercare | No
11530 | NarrativeText | If a prolonged bleeding time is caused by unknown factors or diseases, further testing is required to identify the exact cause of the bleeding problem. | No

11532 | NarrativeText | Hemostasis—The stopping of bleeding or blood flow through a blood vessel or organ. | No
11533 | Title | Normal results | No
11534 | NarrativeText | A normal bleeding time for the Ivy method is less than five minutes from the time of the stab until all bleeding from the wound stops. Some texts extend the normal range to eight minutes. Normal values for the template method range up to eight minutes, while for the modified template methods, up to 10 minutes is considered normal. Normal for the Duke method is three minutes. | No
11535 | Title | Abnormal results | No
11536 | NarrativeText | A bleeding time that is longer than normal is an abnormal result. The test should be stopped if the patient hasn’t stopped bleeding by 20-30 minutes. Bleeding time is longer when the normal function of platelets is impaired, or there are a lower-than-normal number of platelets in the blood. | No
11537 | NarrativeText | A longer-than-normal bleeding time can indicate that one of several defects in hemostasis is present, including severe thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunc- tion, vascular defects, Von Willebrand’s disease, or other abnormalities. | No

11563 | NarrativeText | Liver disease often causes an increase in the blood pressure in the main veins that carry blood from the stomach and intestines to the liver (portal veins). As the pressure in the portal veins increases, the veins of the stomach and esophagus swell, until they eventually become varices. Bleeding varices are a life-threatening complication of this increase in blood pressure (portal hypertension). The most common cause of bleeding varices is cirrhosis of the liver caused by chronic alcohol abuse or hepatitis. Bleeding varices occur in approxi- mately one in every 10,000 people. | No
11564 | NarrativeText | Bleeding varices may be suspected in a patient who has any of the above-mentioned symptoms, and who has either been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or who has a history of prolonged alcohol abuse. The definitive diagnosis is established via a specialized type of endo- scopy, namely, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), a procedure that involves the visual examination of the lin- ing of the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum with a flexible fiberoptic endoscope. | No

11569 | Title | 516 | No
11570 | NarrativeText | Initial treatment of bleeding varices begins with stan- dard resuscitation, including intravenous fluids and blood transfusions as needed. Definitive treatment is usually endoscopic, with the endoscope used to locate the sites of the bleeding. An instrument, inserted along with the endo- scope, is used either to inject these sites with a clotting agent or to tie off the bleeding sites with tiny rubber bands. | No
11571 | NarrativeText | Repeated endoscopic treatments (usually four to six) are generally required to eliminate the varices and to pre- vent the recurrence of bleeding. These endoscopic tech- niques are successful in about 90 percent of cases. | No
11572 | NarrativeText | Patients who cannot be treated endoscopically may be considered for an alternative procedure called TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). This pro- cedure involves placing a hollow metal tube (shunt) in the liver connecting the portal veins with the hepatic veins (veins that leave the liver and drain to the heart). This shunt lowers the pressure in the portal veins and prevents bleeding and portal hypertension. The TIPS pro- cedure is performed by a radiologist and has become an accepted method for reducing portal vein pressure since 1992. Although the procedure continues to evolve, TIPS can routinely be created in more than 93% of patients. | No
11573 | NarrativeText | Medications aimed at controlling bleeding may also be prescribed. These include propanolol, vasopressin, octreotide acetate, and isosorbide mononitrate. | No

11575 | NarrativeText | Some alternative treatments are aimed at preventing the cirrhosis of the liver that often causes bleeding varices and most are effective. However, once a patient has reached the bleeding varice stage, standard intervention to stop the bleeding is required or the patient may die. | No
11576 | Title | Prognosis | No
11577 | NarrativeText | Bleeding varices represent one of the most feared complications of portal hypertension. They contribute to the estimated 32,000 deaths per year attributed to cirrho- sis. Half or more of patients who survive episodes of bleeding varices are at risk of renewed esophageal bleed- ing during the first one to two years. The risk of recur- rence can be lowered by endoscopic and drug treatment. Prognosis is usually more related to the underlying liver disease. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of people with bleeding varices will die from this condition within the six weeks of the first bleeding episode. | No
11578 | Title | Prevention | No
11579 | NarrativeText | The best way to possibly prevent the development or recurrence of bleeding varices is to eliminate the risk fac- tors for cirrhosis of the liver. The most common cause of cirrhosis is prolonged alcohol abuse, and alcohol con- sumption must be completely eliminated. People with hepatitis B or hepatitis C also have an increased risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver. Vaccination against hepatitis B and avoidance of intravenous drug usage reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis. | No

11601 | NarrativeText | Blepharoplasty can be performed on the upper or lower eyelid; it can involve the removal of excess skin and fat deposits and the tightening of selected muscles surrounding the eyelids. The goal is to provide a more youthful appearance. | No
11602 | NarrativeText | The surgeon will begin by deciding whether excess skin, fat deposits, or muscle looseness are at fault. While the patient is sitting upright, the surgeon will mark on the skin where incisions will be made. Care will be taken to hide the incision lines in the natural skin folds above and below the eye. The patient then receives injections of a local anesthetic to numb the pain. Many surgeons also give the patient a sedative intravenously during the procedure. | No
11603 | NarrativeText | After a small, crescent-shaped section of eyelid skin is removed, the surgeon will work to tease out small pockets of fat that have collected in the lids. If muscle looseness is also a problem, the surgeon may trim tissue or add a stitch to pull it tighter. Then the incision is closed with stitches. | No
11604 | NarrativeText | In some patients, fat deposits in the lower eyelid may be the only or primary problem. Such patients may be good candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty. In this procedure the surgeon makes no incision on the sur- face of the eyelid, but instead enters from behind to tease out the fat deposits from a small incision. The advantage of this procedure is that there is no visible scar. | No

11606 | NarrativeText | Prior to surgery, patients meet with their surgeon to discuss the procedure, clarify the results that can be achieved, and discuss the potential problems that might occur. Having realistic expectations is important in any cosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, that although blepharoplasty can improve the appearance of the eyelid, other procedures, such as a chemical peel, will be necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinkles around the eye. Some surgeons prescribe vitamin C and vitamin K for 10 days prior to surgery in the belief that this helps the healing process. Patients are also told to stop smoking in the weeks before and after the proce- dure, and to refrain from alcohol and aspirin. | No

11608 | NarrativeText | An antibiotic ointment is applied to the line of stitch- es for several days after surgery. Patients also take an antibiotic several times a day to prevent infection. Ice- cold compresses are applied to the eyes continuously for the first day following surgery, and several times a day for the next week or so, to reduce swelling. Some swelling and discoloration around the eyes is expected with the procedure. Patients should avoid aspirin or alcoholic bev- erages for one week and should limit their activities, including bending, straining, and lifting. The stitches are removed a few days after surgery. Patients can generally return to their usual activities within a week to 10 days. | No
11609 | Title | Risks | No
11610 | NarrativeText | As with any surgical procedure, blepharoplasty can lead to infection and scarring. Good care of the wound fol- lowing surgery can minimize these risks. In cases where too much skin is removed from the eyelids, the patient may have difficulty closing his eyes. Dry eye syndrome may develop, requiring the use of artificial tears to lubri- cate the eye. In a rare complication, called retrobulbar hematoma, a pocket of blood forms behind the eyeball. | No
11611 | Title | Normal results | No
11612 | NarrativeText | Most patients can expect good results from blepharo- plasty, with the removal of excess eyelid skin and fat pro- ducing a more youthful appearance. Some swelling and discoloration is expected immediately following the pro- cedure, but this clears in time. Small scars will be left where the surgeon has made incisions; but these generally lighten in appearance over several months, and, if placed correctly, will not be readily noticeable. | No
11613 | Title | Abnormal results | No
11614 | NarrativeText | As noted, if too much excess skin is removed from the upper eyelid, the patient may be unable to close his eyes completely; another surgery to correct the defect may be required. Similarly, too much skin can be removed from the lower eyelid, allowing too much of the white of the eye (the sclera) to show. In extreme cases, the lower lid may be pulled down too far, revealing the underlying tissue. Called an ectropion, this, too, may require a second, corrective surgery. The eye’s ability to make tears may also be compromised, leading to dry eye syndrome. Dry eye syndrome is potentially dangerous; in rare cases it leads to damage to the cornea of the eye and vision loss. | No

11664 | NarrativeText | One of the most commonly ordered clinical labora- tory tests, a blood count, also called a complete blood count (CBC), is a basic evaluation of the cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) suspended in the liquid part of the blood (plasma). It involves determining the numbers, concentrations, and conditions of the differ- ent types of blood cells. | No
11665 | Title | Purpose | No
11666 | NarrativeText | The CBC is a useful screening and diagnostic test that is often done as part of a routine physical examina- tion. It can provide valuable information about the blood and blood-forming tissues (especially the bone marrow), as well as other body systems. Abnormal results can indi- cate the presence of a variety of conditions—including anemias, leukemias, and infections—sometimes before the patient experiences symptoms of the disease. | No
11667 | Title | Description | No
11668 | NarrativeText | A complete blood count is actually a series of tests in which the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in a given volume of blood are count- ed. The CBC also measures the hemoglobin content and the packed cell volume (hematocrit) of the red blood cells, assesses the size and shape of the red blood cells, and determines the types and percentages of white blood cells. Components of the complete blood count (hemo- globin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, etc.) can also be tested separately, and are sometimes done that way when a doctor wants to monitor a specific condition, such as the white cell count of a patient diagnosed with leukemia, or the hemoglobin of a patient who has recent- ly received a blood transfusion. Because of its value, though, as an indicator of a person’s overall health, the CBC package is most frequently ordered. | No
11669 | NarrativeText | The blood count is performed relatively inexpen- sively and quickly. Most laboratories routinely use some type of automated equipment to dilute the blood, sample a measured volume of the diluted suspension, and count the cells in that volume. In addition to counting actual numbers of red cells, white cells, and platelets, the auto- mated cell counters also measure the hemoglobin and calculate the hematocrit and the red blood cell indices (measures of the size and hemoglobin content of the red blood cells). Technologists then examine a stained blood smear under the microscope to identify any abnormali- ties in the appearance of the red blood cells and to report the types and percentages of white blood cells observed. | No
11670 | NarrativeText | A white blood cell. (Photograph by Institut Pasteur, Phototake NYC. Reproduced by permission.) | No
11671 | NarrativeText | The red blood cell (RBC) count determines the total number of red cells (erythrocytes) in a sample of blood. The red cells, the most numerous of the cellular ele- ments, carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues. Hemoglobin (Hgb) is the protein-iron compound in the red blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen. Its concentration corresponds closely to the RBC count. Also closely tied to the RBC and hemoglobin values is the hematocrit (Hct), which measures the percentage of red blood cells in the total blood volume. The hematocrit (expressed as percentage points) is normally about three times the hemoglobin concentration (reported as grams per deciliter). | No
11672 | NarrativeText | Red blood cell indices provide information about the size and hemoglobin content of the red cells. They are useful in differentiating types of anemias. The indices include four measurements that are calculated using the RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit results. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the aver- age size of the red blood cells and indicates whether that is small, large or normal. The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is an indication of the variation in RBC size. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) measures the average amount (weight) of hemoglobin within a red blood cell. A similar measurement, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), expresses the aver- age concentration of hemoglobin in the red blood cells. | No
11673 | NarrativeText | The white blood cell (WBC) count determines the total number of white cells (leukocytes) in the blood sample. Fewer in number than the red cells, WBCs are the body’s primary means of fighting infection. There are five main types of white cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), each of which plays a different role in responding to the presence of foreign organisms in the body. A differential white cell count is done by staining a smear of the patient’s blood with a Wright’s stain, allowing the different types of white cells to be clearly seen under the microscope. A technologist then counts a minimum of 100 WBCs and reports each type of white cell as a percentage of the total white blood cells counted. | No
11674 | NarrativeText | The platelet count is an actual count of the number of platelets (thrombocytes) in a given volume of blood. Platelets, the smallest of the cellular elements of blood, are involved in blood clotting. Because platelets can clump together, the automated counting method is sub- ject to a certain level of error and may not be accurate enough for low platelet counts. For this reason, very low platelet levels are often counted manually. | No
11675 | Title | Normal results | No
11676 | NarrativeText | Blood count values can vary by age and sex. The normal red blood cell count ranges from 4.2—5.4 million RBCs per microliter of blood for men and 3.6-5.0 mil- lion for women. Hemoglobin values range from 14-18 grams per deciliter of blood for men and 12-16 grams for women. The normal hematocrit is 42-54% for men and 36-48% for women. The normal number of white blood cells for both men and women is approximately 4,000-10,000 WBCs per microliter of blood. | No
11677 | Title | Abnormal results | No
11678 | NarrativeText | Abnormal blood count results are seen in a variety of conditions. One of the most common is anemias, which are characterized by low RBC counts, hemoglobins, and hematocrits. Infections and leukemias are associated with increased numbers of WBCs. | No

11687 | NarrativeText | A blood culture is done when a person has symp- toms of a blood infection, also called bacteremia. Blood is drawn from the person one or more times and is tested in a laboratory to find and identify any microorganism present and growing in the blood. If a microorganism is found, more testing is done to determine the antibiotics that will be effective in treating the infection. | No
11688 | Title | Purpose | No
11689 | NarrativeText | Bacteremia is a serious clinical condition and can lead to death. To give the best chance for effective treat- ment and survival, a blood culture is done as soon as an infection is suspected. | No
11690 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of bacteremia are fever, chills, mental confusion, anxiety, rapid heart beat, hyperventilation, blood clotting problems, and shock. These symptoms are especially significant in a person who already has anoth- er illness or infection, is hospitalized, or has trouble fighting infections because of a weak immune system. Often, the blood infection results from an infection somewhere else in the body that has now spread. | No
11691 | NarrativeText | Additionally, blood cultures are done to find the causes of other infections. These include bacterial pneu- monia (an infection of the lung), and infectious endo- carditis (an infection of the inner layer of the heart). Both of these infections leak bacteria into the blood. | No
11692 | NarrativeText | After a blood infection has been diagnosed, con- firmed by culture, and treated, an additional blood cul- ture may be done to make sure the infection is gone. | No
11693 | Title | Description | No
11694 | Title | Culture strategies | No
11695 | NarrativeText | There are many variables involved in performing a blood culture. Before the person’s blood is drawn, the physician must make several decisions based on a knowl- edge of infections and the person’s clinical condition and medical history. | No
11696 | NarrativeText | Several groups of microorganisms, including bacte- ria, viruses, mold, and yeast, can cause blood infections. The bacteria group can be further broken down into aer- obes and anaerobes. Most aerobes do not need oxygen to live. They can grow with oxygen (aerobic microbes) or without oxygen (anaerobic microbes). | No
11697 | NarrativeText | Based on the clinical condition of the patient, the physician determines what group of microorganisms is likely to be causing the infection and then orders one or more specific types of blood culture, including aerobic, anaerobic, viral, or fungal (for yeasts and molds). Each specific type of culture is handled differently by the labo- ratory. Most blood cultures test for both aerobic and anaerobic microbes. Fungal, viral, and mycobacterial blood cultures can also be done, but are less common. | No
11698 | NarrativeText | The physician must also decide how many blood cultures should be done. One culture is rarely enough, but two to three are usually adequate. Four cultures are occasionally required. Some factors influencing this decision are the specific microorganisms the physician expects to find based on the person’s symptoms or previ- ous culture results, and whether or not the person has had recent antibiotic therapy. | No
11699 | NarrativeText | The time at which the cultures are to be drawn is another decision made by the physician. During most blood infections (called intermittent bacteremia) microor- ganisms enter the blood at various time intervals. Blood drawn randomly may miss the microorganisms. Since microorganisms enter the blood 30-90 minutes before the person’s fever spikes, collecting the culture just after the fever spike offers the best likelihood of finding the microorganism. The second and third cultures may be collected at the same time, but from different places on the person, or spaced at 30-minute or one-hour intervals, as the physician chooses. During continuous bacteremia, such as infective endocarditis, microorganisms are always in the blood and the timing of culture collection is less important. Blood cultures should always be collected before antibiotic treatment has begun. | No
11700 | Title | Laboratory analysis | No
11701 | NarrativeText | Bacteria are the most common microorganisms found in blood infections. Laboratory analysis of a bacte- rial blood culture differs slightly from that of a fungal culture and significantly from that of a viral culture. | No
11702 | NarrativeText | Blood is drawn from a person and put directly into a blood culture bottle containing a nutritional broth. After the laboratory receives the blood culture bottle, several processes must be completed: * provide an environment for the bacteria to grow ¢ detect the growth when it occurs | No
11703 | ListItem | + identify the bacteria that grow * test the bacteria against certain antibiotics to determine which antibiotic will be effective | No
11704 | NarrativeText | There are several types of systems, both manual and automated, available to laboratories to carry out these processes. | No
11705 | NarrativeText | The broth in the blood culture bottle is the first step in creating an environment in which bacteria will grow. It contains all the nutrients that bacteria need to grow. If the physician expects anaerobic bacteria to grow, oxygen will be kept out of the blood culture bottle; if aerobes are expected, oxygen will be allowed in the bottle. | No
11706 | NarrativeText | The bottles are placed in an incubator and kept at body temperature. They are watched daily for signs of growth, including cloudiness or a color change in the broth, gas bubbles, or clumps of bacteria. When there is evidence of growth, the laboratory does a gram stain and a subculture. To do the gram stain, a drop of blood is removed from the bottle and placed on a microscope slide. The blood is allowed to dry and then is stained with purple and red stains and examined under the micro- scope. If bacteria are seen, the color of stain they picked up (purple or red), their shape (such as round or rectan- gular), and their size provide valuable clues as to what type of microorganism they are and what antibiotics might work best. To do the subculture, a drop of blood is placed on a culture plate, spread over the surface, and placed in an incubator. | No
11707 | NarrativeText | If there is no immediate visible evidence of growth in the bottles, the laboratory looks for bacteria by doing gram stains and subcultures. These steps are repeated daily for the first several days and periodically after that. | No
11708 | NarrativeText | When bacteria grows, the laboratory identifies it using biochemical tests and the gram stain. Sensitivity testing, also called antibiotic susceptibility testing, is also done. The bacteria are tested against many different antibiotics to see which antibiotics can effectively kill it. | No
11709 | NarrativeText | All information is passed on to the physician as soon as it is known. An early report, known as a preliminary report, is usually available after one day. This report will tell if any bacteria have been found yet, and if so, the results of the gram stain. The next preliminary report may include a description of the bacteria growing on the sub- culture. The laboratory notifies the physician immediately when an organism is found and as soon as sensitivity tests are complete. Sensitivity tests may be complete before the bacteria is completely identified. The final report may not be available for five to seven days. If bacteria was found, the report will include its complete identification and a list of the antibiotics to which the bacteria is sensitive. | No
11710 | NarrativeText | One automated system is considered one of the most important recent technical advances in blood cultures. It is called continuous-monitoring blood culture systems (CMCCS). The instruments automatically monitor the bottles containing the patient blood for evidence of microorganisms, usually every 10 minutes. Many data points are collected daily for each bottle, and fed into a computer for analysis. Sophisticated mathematical calcu- lations can determine when microorganisms have grown.

11720 | Title | Preparation | No
11721 | NarrativeText | Ten ml (milliliter) of blood is usually needed for each blood culture bottle. First a healthcare worker locates a vein in the inner elbow region. The area of skin where the blood will be drawn must be disinfected to prevent any microorganisms on a person’s skin from entering the blood culture bottle and contaminating it. The area is disinfected by wiping the area with alcohol in a circular fashion, starting with tiny circles at the spot where the needle will puncture the skin and enlarging the size of the circles while wiping away from the puncture site. The same pattern of wiping is repeated using an iodine or iodophor solution. The top of the bottle is disin- fected using alcohol. After the person’s skin has been disinfected, the healthcare worker draws the blood and about 10 ml of blood is injected into each blood culture bottle. The type of bottles used will vary based on whether the physician is looking for bacteria (aerobes or anaerobes), yeast, mold, or viruses. | No
11722 | Title | Aftercare | No

11728 | Title | Abnormal results | No
11729 | NarrativeText | The physician’s skill in interpreting the culture results and assessing the person’s clinical condition is essential in distinguishing a blood culture that is positive because of a true infection from a culture that is positive because it became contaminated. In true bacteremia, the patient’s clinical condition should be consistent with a blood infection caused by the microorganism that was found. The microorganism is usually found in more than one culture, it usually grows soon after the bottles are incubated, and it is often the cause of an infection some- where else in the person’s body. | No
11730 | NarrativeText | When the culture is positive because of contamina- tion, the patient’s clinical condition usually is not consis- tent with an infection from the identified microorganism. In addition, the microorganism is often one commonly found on skin, it rarely causes infection, it is found in only one bottle, and it may appear after several days of incubation. More than one microorganism often grow in contaminated cultures. | No

11741 | NarrativeText | Blood donation refers to the process of collecting, testing, preparing, and storing blood and blood compo- nents. Donors are most commonly unpaid volunteers, but they may also be paid by commercial enterprises. Blood registry refers to the collection and sharing of data about donated blood and ineligible donors. | No
11742 | Title | Purpose | No
11743 | NarrativeText | The purpose of the blood collection and distribution system is to help ensure an adequate supply of blood for accident victims, people needing surgery, and people suffer- ing from certain diseases, as well as for medical research. | No
11744 | NarrativeText | Sometimes, donors give blood specifically to benefit a particular person. People preparing for elective surgery may donate their own blood to be held and then returned to them during surgery. This is known as autologous blood donation. Directed donor blood has been donated by someone known to the intended recipient, such as a family member or friend. | No
11745 | NarrativeText | Each year, more than four million Americans receive blood transfusions involving more than 26 million units of blood (one unit equals 450 milliliters, or about one pint), or an average of about 32,000 units per day. All of that blood must be collected, tested, prepared, stored, and delivered to the appropriate sites. Roughly eight million people in the United States donate blood each year; about half of the total amount needed is provided by the 36 regional blood centers of the American Red Cross. | No
11746 | NarrativeText | Whole blood and the various blood components have many uses. Red blood cells, which carry oxygen, are used to treat anemia. Platelets, which play a role in controlling bleeding, are commonly used in the treatment of leukemia and other cancers. Fresh frozen plasma is also used to control bleeding in people deficient in certain clotting factors. Cryoprecipitated AHF, made from fresh frozen plasma, contains a few specific clotting factors. | No
11747 | Title | Precautions | No
11748 | NarrativeText | To ensure the safety of the blood supply, a multi- tiered process of donor screening and deferral is employed. This involves donor education, taking a detailed health history of each prospective donor, and giving potential donors a simple physical examination (which includes taking a few drops of blood to test for anemia). At any point in the process, a potential donor may be “deferred,” or judged ineligible to donate blood. This deferral may be temporary or permanent, depending on the reason. Potential donors are also encouraged to “self-defer,” or voluntarily decline to donate, rather than put future blood recipients at risk. | No
11749 | NarrativeText | All donated blood is extensively tested before being used. The first step is determining the blood type, which indicates who can receive the blood. Receiving the wrong type of blood can cause death. Blood is also screened for any antibodies that could cause complications for recipi- ents. In addition, blood is tested to screen out donors infected with the following diseases: Hepatitis B surface antigen ADD, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C virus antibody, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody, HIV p24 antigen, HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies, and syphilis. Nucleic Acid Amplification testing is also performed, and other tests may be done if a doctor requests them. | No
11750 | NarrativeText | In order to detect the greatest possible number of infections, these screening tests are extremely sensitive. For this reason, however, donors sometimes receive false positive test results. In these cases, more specific confir- matory tests are performed, to help rule out false positive results. Blood found to be abnormal is discarded, and all items coming into direct contact with donors are used only once and then discarded. Donors of infected blood are entered into the Donor Deferral Register, a confiden- tial national data base used to prevent deferred people from donating blood. | No
11751 | NarrativeText | In general, blood donors must be at least 17 years old (some states allow younger people to donate blood with their parents’ consent), must weigh at least 110 pounds (50 kg), and must be in good health. | No
11752 | NarrativeText | Many factors can temporarily or permanently dis- qualify potential donors. Most of them have to do with having engaged in behaviors that put them at risk of infection or having spent time in certain specified areas. Among these factors are having had a tattoo, having had sex with people in high-risk groups, having had certain diseases, and having been raped. | No
11753 | Title | Description | No
11754 | NarrativeText | There are eight different blood types in all—four ABO groups, each of which may be either Rh positive or Rh negative. These types, and their approximate distribu- tion in the U.S. population, are as follows: O+ (38%), O- (7%), A+ (34%), A- (6%), B+ (9%), B- (2%), AB+ (3%), AB- (1%). In an emergency, anyone can safely receive type O red blood cells, and people with this blood type are known as “universal donors. “ People with type AB blood, known as “universal recipients,” can receive any type of red blood cells and can give plasma to all blood types. | No
11755 | NarrativeText | Blood donations can be made in community blood centers, at hospitals or in bloodmobiles, which visit schools, churches and workplaces. The actual process of donating whole blood takes about 20 minutes. A sterile needle is inserted into a vein in the donor’s arm. The blood flows through plastic tubing into a blood bag. Donors may be asked to clench their fist to encourage blood to flow. Usually, one unit of blood is collected. Afterward, donors are escorted to an observation area, given light refreshments, and allowed to rest. | No

11763 | NarrativeText | Plasma, the liquid portion of the blood in which red blood cells, platelets and other elements are suspended, is also collected, often by commercial enterprises that sell it to companies manufacturing clotting factors and other blood products. This is done using a process known as apheresis, in which whole blood is collected, the desired blood component is removed, and the remainder is returned to the donor. Collecting plasma generally takes one to two hours. Apheresis may also be used to collect other blood components, such as platelets and granulocytes. | No
11764 | Title | Preparation | No
11765 | NarrativeText | Once whole blood has been collected, it is sent to a lab for testing and processing. Most donated blood is separated into its constituent components, such as red blood cells, platelets, and cryoprecipitate. This enables more than one person to benefit from the same unit of donated blood. | No
11766 | NarrativeText | Different blood components vary in how long they can be stored. Red blood cells can be refrigerated for up to 42 days or frozen for as much as 10 years. Platelets, stored at room temperature, may be kept for up to five days. Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitated AHF can be kept for as much as one year. | No
11767 | Title | Aftercare | No
11768 | NarrativeText | It generally takes about 24 hours for the donor’s body to replenish the lost fluid. Replacing the lost red blood cells, however, may take as much as two months. Whole blood donors must wait a minimum of eight weeks before donating again. Some states place further limits on the frequency and/or total number of times an individual may donate blood within a 12-month period. | No

Nonetheless, there is still a minuscule risk that blood recipients could con- tract HIV, Hepatitis C, or other infections via transfu- sion. Other diseases that could conceivably be contract- ed in this way, or that are of particular concern to blood-collection agencies, include babesiosis, Chagas disease, HTLV-I and -II, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cytomegalovirus, Lyme disease, malaria, and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. | No
11773 | NarrativeText | Autologous blood donors run a tiny risk of having the wrong blood returned to them due to clerical error. There is also a faint possibility of bacterial contamina- tion of the autologous blood. | No
11774 | Title | Normal results | No
11775 | NarrativeText | For most donors, the process is quick and painless and they leave feeling fine. They may also find satisfac- tion in knowing that they have contributed to the nation’s blood supply and may even have helped save lives. | No
11776 | Title | Abnormal results | No
11777 | NarrativeText | Most blood donors suffer no significant aftereffects. Occasionally, however, donors feel faint or dizzy, nau- seous, and/or have pain, redness, or a bruise where the blood was taken. More serious complications, which rarely occur, include fainting, muscle spasms, and nerve damage. | No

11791 | NarrativeText | Blood gas analysis, also called arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, is a test which measures the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as the acidity (pH) of the blood. | No
11792 | Title | Purpose | No
11793 | NarrativeText | An ABG analysis evaluates how effectively the lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood and how effi- ciently they are eliminating carbon dioxide from it. The test also indicates how well the lungs and kidneys are interacting to maintain normal blood pH (acid-base bal- ance). Blood gas studies are usually done to assess respi- ratory disease and other conditions that may affect the lungs, and to manage patients receiving oxygen therapy (respiratory therapy). In addition, the acid-base compo- nent of the test provides information on kidney function. | No
11794 | Title | Description | No
11795 | NarrativeText | Blood gas analysis is performed on blood from an artery. It measures the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as oxygen content, oxygen saturation, bicarbonate content, and blood pH. | No
11796 | NarrativeText | Oxygen in the lungs is carried to the tissues through the bloodstream, but only a small amount of this oxygen can actually dissolve in arterial blood. How much dis- solves depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen (the pressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the arteries). Therefore, testing the partial pressure of oxygen is actu- ally measuring how much oxygen the lungs are deliver- ing to the blood. Carbon dioxide is released into the blood as a by-product of cell metabolism. The partial carbon dioxide pressure indicates how well the lungs are eliminating this carbon dioxide. | No
11797 | NarrativeText | The remainder of oxygen that is not dissolved in the blood combines with hemoglobin, a protein—iron com- pound found in the red blood cells. The oxygen content measurement in an ABG analysis indicates how much oxygen is combined with the hemoglobin. A related value is the oxygen saturation, which compares the amount of oxygen actually combined with hemoglobin to the total amount of oxygen that the hemoglobin is capa- ble of combining with. | No
11798 | NarrativeText | Carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in the blood than oxygen does, primarily forming bicarbonate and smaller amounts of carbonic acid. When present in nor- mal amounts, the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonate creates an acid-base balance in the blood, helping to keep A blood gas analyzer from Corning Corporation.

The lungs control the carbonic acid level and the kidneys reg- ulate the bicarbonate. If either organ is not functioning properly, an acid-base imbalance can result. Determina- tion of bicarbonate and pH levels, then, aids in diagnos- ing the cause of abnormal blood gas values. | No
11800 | Title | The procedure | No
11801 | NarrativeText | The blood sample is obtained by arterial puncture (usu- ally in the wrist, although it could be in the groin or arm) or from an arterial line already in place. If a puncture is need- ed, the skin over the artery is cleaned with an antiseptic. A technician then collects the blood with a small sterile needle attached to a disposable syringe. The patient may feel a brief throbbing or cramping at the site of the puncture. After the blood is drawn, the sample must be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible for analysis. | No
11802 | Title | KEY TERMS | No

11806 | Title | Preparation | No
11807 | NarrativeText | There are no special preparations. Patients have no restrictions on drinking or eating before the test. If the patient is receiving oxygen, the oxygen concentration must remain the same for 20 minutes before the test; if the test is to be taken without oxygen, the gas must be turned off for 20 minutes before the test is taken. The patient should breathe normally during the test. | No
11808 | Title | Aftercare | No
11809 | NarrativeText | After the blood has been taken, the technician or the patient applies pressure to the puncture site for 10-15 minutes to stop the bleeding, and then places a dressing over the puncture.The patient should rest quietly while applying the pressure to the puncture site. Health care workers will observe the patient for signs of bleeding or circulation problems | No
11810 | Title | Risks | No
11811 | NarrativeText | Risks are very low when the test is done correctly. Risks include bleeding or bruising at the site, or delayed bleeding from the site. Very rarely, there may be a prob- lem with circulation in the puncture area. | No

11829 | NarrativeText | Blood sugar tests include several different tests that measure the amount of sugar (glucose) in a person’s blood. These tests are done either on an empty stomach, or after consuming a meal or premeasured glucose drink. Blood sugar tests are done primarily to diagnose and evaluate a person with diabetes mellitus. | No
11830 | Title | Purpose | No
11831 | NarrativeText | The body uses sugar, also called glucose, to supply the energy it needs to function. People get sugar from their diet and from their body tissues. Insulin is made by the pancreas and affects the outer membrane of cells, making it easy for glucose to move from the blood into the cells. When insulin is active, blood glucose levels fall. Sugar from body tissues is stored in the form of glycogen. When glycogen is active, blood glucose levels rise. | No
11832 | NarrativeText | After a meal, blood glucose levels rise sharply. The pancreas responds by releasing enough insulin to take care of all the newly added sugar found in the body. The insulin moves the sugar out of the blood and into the cells. Only then does the blood sugar start to level off and begin to fall. A person with diabetes mellitus either does not make enough insulin, or makes insulin that does not work properly. The result is blood sugar that remains high, a condition called hyperglycemia. | No
11833 | NarrativeText | Diabetes must be diagnosed as early as possible. If left untreated, it can damage or cause failure of the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other body organs. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, may also be discovered through blood sugar testing. Hypoglycemia is caused by various hormone disorders and liver disease, as well as by too much insulin. | No
11834 | Title | Description | No
11835 | NarrativeText | There are a variety of ways to measure a person’s blood sugar. | No
11836 | Title | Whole blood glucose test | No
11837 | NarrativeText | Whole blood glucose testing can be performed by a person in his or her home, and kits are available for this purpose. The person pricks his or her finger (a finger stick) with a sterile sharp blade from the kit. A single drop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable instrument called a glucometer. The glucometer quickly determines the blood sugar and shows the results on a small screen in usually a few seconds. | No
11838 | Title | Fasting plasma glucose test | No
11839 | NarrativeText | The fasting plasma glucose test is done on an empty stomach. For the eight hours before the test, the person must fast (nothing to eat or drink, except water). The per- son’s blood is drawn from a vein by a healthcare worker. The blood sample is collected into a tube containing an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants stop the blood from clot- ting. In the laboratory, the tube of blood spins at high speed within a machine called a centrifuge. The blood cells sink to the bottom and the liquid stays on the top. This straw-colored liquid on the top is the plasma. To measure the glucose, a person’s plasma is combined with other substances. From the resulting reaction, the amount of glucose in the plasma is determined. | No
11840 | Title | Oral glucose tolerance test | No
11841 | NarrativeText | The oral glucose tolerance test is done to see how well the body handles a standard amount of glucose. This test measures the amount of glucose in a person’s plasma before and two hours after drinking a large premeasured beverage containing glucose. The person must eat a con- sistent diet, containing at least 5.250z (150 g) of carbohy- drates each day, for three days before this test. For eight hours before the test, the person must fast. A healthcare provider draws the first sample of blood at the end of the fast to determine the glucose level at the start of the test. The healthcare provider then gives the person a beverage containing 2.6 oz (75 g) of glucose. Two hours later, the person’s blood is drawn again. These blood samples are centrifuged and processed in the laboratory. A doctor can then compare the before and after glucose levels to see how well the body processed the sugar. | No
11842 | Title | Two-hour postprandial blood glucose test | No
11843 | NarrativeText | The two-hour postprandial blood glucose test mea- sures the amount of glucose in plasma after a person eats a specific meal containing a certain amount of sugar. Although the meal follows a predetermined menu, it is difficult to control many factors associated with this test- ing method. | No
11844 | NarrativeText | Blood sugar tests can be used in a variety of situa- tions including: * Testing people suspected for diabetes. The American Diabetic Association (ADA) recommends that either a fasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test be used to diagnose diabetes. If the person already has symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose test without fasting (called a casual plasma glucose test) may be done. If the test result is abnormal, it must be confirmed with another test performed on another day. The two tests can be different or they can be the same, but they must be done on different days. If the second test is also abnormal, the person has diabetes. A two-hour post- prandial test is not recommended by the ADA as a test to use for the diagnosis of diabetes. A doctor may order this test, and follow it with the oral glucose tolerance test or the fasting plasma glucose test if the results are abnormal. | No
11845 | ListItem | Testing pregnant women. Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) is dangerous for both the mother and the baby. Women who may be at risk are screened when they are 24-28 weeks pregnant. A woman is considered at risk if she is older than 25 years, is not at her normal body weight, has a parent or sibling with diabetes, or if she is in an ethnic group that has a high rate of diabetes (Hispanics, Native Ameri- cans, Asians, African Americans). The blood sugar test to screen for gestational diabetes is a variation of the oral glucose tolerance test. Fasting is not required. If the result is abnormal, a more complete test is done on another day. | No
11846 | ListItem | Testing healthy people. Healthy people without symp- toms of diabetes should be screened for diabetes when they are 45 years old and again every three years. Either the fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test is used for screening. People in high risk groups should be tested before the age of 45 and tested more frequently. | No
11847 | ListItem | + Testing of people already diagnosed with diabetes. The ADA recommends that a person with diabetes keep the amount of glucose in the blood at a normal level as much as possible. This can be done by the diabetic person test- ing his or her own blood at home one or more times a day. | No
11848 | Title | Preparation | No
11849 | NarrativeText | Each blood sugar test that uses plasma requires a 5 mL blood sample. A healthcare worker ties a tight band (tourniquet) on the person’s upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the needle into an attached tube. Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes. | No
11850 | NarrativeText | When fasting is required, the person should have nothing to eat or drink (except water) for eight hours before the test and until the test or series of tests is com- pleted. The person should not smoke before or during the testing period because this can temporarily increase the amount of glucose in the blood. Other factors that can cause inaccurate results are a change in diet before the test, illness or surgery two weeks before the test, certain drugs, and extended bed rest. The doctor may tell a per- son on insulin or taking pills for diabetes to stop the medication until after the test. | No
11851 | Title | Aftercare | No
11852 | NarrativeText | After the test or series of tests is completed (and with the approval of his or her doctor), the person should eat, drink, and take any medications that were stopped for the test. | No
11853 | NarrativeText | The patient may feel discomfort when blood is drawn from a vein. Bruising may occur at the puncture site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc- ture site until the bleeding stops will reduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort. | No
11854 | Title | Risks | No
11855 | NarrativeText | If the person experiences any weakness, fainting, sweating, or any other unusual reaction while fasting or during the test, he or she should immediately tell the per- son giving the test. | No
11856 | Title | Normal results | No
11857 | NarrativeText | Normal results are: + fasting plasma glucose test less than 120 mg/dL + oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than 140 mg/dL | No
11858 | NarrativeText | For the diabetic person, the ADA recommends an ongo- ing blood sugar goal of less than or equal to 120 mg/dL. | No
11859 | Title | 530 | No
11860 | Title | Abnormal results | No
11861 | NarrativeText | These abnormal results indicate diabetes and must be confirmed with repeat testing: * fasting plasma glucose test less than or equal to 126 mg/dL + oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than or equal to 200 mg/dL | No
11862 | ListItem | * casual plasma glucose test (nonfasting, with symptoms) less than or equal to 200 mg/dL * gestational oral glucose tolerance test, 1 hour less than or equal to 140 mg/dL | No
11863 | NarrativeText | Brain damage can occur from glucose levels below 40 mg/dL and coma from levels above 470 mg/dL. | No
11864 | NarrativeText | Other hormone disorders can cause both hyper- glycemia and hypoglycemia. Abnormal results must be interpreted by a doctor who is aware of the person’s med- ical condition and medical history. | No

11881 | NarrativeText | Blood typing is a laboratory test done to determine a person’s blood type. If the person needs a blood transfu- sion, another test called crossmatching is done after the blood is typed to find blood from a donor that the per- son’s body will accept. | No
11882 | Title | Purpose | No
11883 | NarrativeText | Blood typing and crossmatching are most common- ly done to make certain that a person who needs a trans- fusion will receive blood that matches (is compatible with) his own. People must receive blood of the same blood type, otherwise, a serious, even fatal, transfusion reaction can occur. | No
11884 | NarrativeText | Parents who are expecting a baby have their blood typed to diagnose and prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), a type of anemia also known as ery- throblastosis fetalis. Babies who have a blood type dif- ferent from their mothers are at risk for developing this disease. The disease is serious with certain blood type differences, but is milder with others. | No
11885 | NarrativeText | A child inherits factors or genes from each parent that determine his blood type. This fact makes blood typ- ing useful in paternity testing. To determine whether or not the alleged father could be the true father, the blood types of the child, mother, and alleged father are com- pared. | No
11886 | NarrativeText | Legal investigations may require typing of blood or other body fluids, such as semen or saliva, to identify persons involved in crimes or other legal matters. | No
11887 | Title | Description | No
11888 | NarrativeText | Blood typing and crossmatching tests are performed in a blood bank laboratory by technologists trained in blood bank and transfusion services. The tests are done on blood, after it has separated into cells and serum (serum is the yellow liquid left after the blood clots.) Costs for both tests are covered by insurance when the tests are determined to be medically necessary. | No
11889 | NarrativeText | Blood bank laboratories are usually located in facili- ties, such as those operated by the American Red Cross, that collect, process, and supply blood that is donated, as well as in facilities, such as most hospitals, that prepare blood for transfusion. These laboratories are regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are often inspected and accredited by a professional association such as the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). | No
11890 | NarrativeText | Blood typing and crossmatching tests are based on the reaction between antigens and antibodies. An antigen can be anything that causes the body to launch an attack, known as an immune response, against it. The attack begins when the body builds a special protein, called an antibody, that is uniquely designed to attack and make ineffective (neutralize) the specific antigen that caused the attack. A person’s body normally doesn’t make anti- bodies against its own antigens, only against antigens that are foreign to it. | No
11891 | NarrativeText | A person’s body contains many antigens. The anti- gens found on the surface of red blood cells are impor- tant because they determine a person’s blood type. When red blood cells having a certain blood type antigen are mixed with serum containing antibodies against that anti- gen, the antibodies attack and stick to the antigen. In a test tube, this reaction is observed as the formation of clumps of cells (clumping). | No
11892 | NarrativeText | When blood is typed, a person’s cells and serum are mixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared serum and cells. Clumping tells which antigens or antibodies are present and reveals the person’s blood type. When blood is crossmatched, patient serum is mixed with cells from donated blood that might be used for transfusion. Clumping or lack of clumping in the test tube tells whether or not the blood is compatible. | No
11893 | NarrativeText | Although there are over 600 known red blood cell antigens, organized into 22 blood group systems, routine blood typing and crossmatching is usually concerned with only two systems: the ABO and Rh blood group systems. | No
11895 | NarrativeText | ABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. In 1901, Karl Land- steiner, an Austrian pathologist, randomly combined the serum and red blood cells of his colleagues. From the reactions he observed in test tubes, he discovered the ABO blood group system. This discovery earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine. | No
11896 | NarrativeText | A person’s ABO blood type—A, B, AB, or O—is based on the presence or absence of the A and B antigens on his red blood cells. The A blood type has only the A antigen and the B blood type has only the B antigen. The AB blood type has both A and B antigens, and the O blood type has neither A nor B antigen. | No

11901 | NarrativeText | In some people, ABO antigens can be found in body fluids other than blood, such as saliva and semen. ABO typing of these fluids provides clues in legal investigations. | No
11902 | NarrativeText | ABO typing is the first test done on blood when it is tested for transfusion. A person must receive ABO- matched blood. ABO incompatibilities are the major cause of fatal transfusion reactions. ABO antigens are also found on most body organs, so ABO compatibility is also important for organ transplants. | No
11903 | NarrativeText | RH BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. The Rh, or Rhesus, system was first detected in 1940 by Landsteiner and Wiener when they injected blood from rhesus monkeys into guinea pigs and rabbits. More than 50 antigens have since been discovered belonging to this system, making it the most complex red blood cell antigen system. | No
11904 | NarrativeText | An ABO incompatibility between a pregnant woman and her baby is a minor cause of HDN and usually causes no problem for the baby. The structure of ABO antibod- ies makes it unlikely they will cross the placenta to attack the baby’s red blood cells. | No
11905 | NarrativeText | In routine blood typing and crossmatching tests, only one of these 50 antigens, the D antigen, also known as the Rh factor or Rh,[D], is tested for. If the D antigen is present, that person is Rh-positive; if the D antigen is absent, that person is Rh-negative. | No
11906 | NarrativeText | Paternity testing compares the ABO blood types of the child, mother, and alleged father. The alleged father can’t be the true father if the child’s blood type requires a gene that neither he nor the mother have. For example, a child with blood type B whose mother has blood type O, | No
11907 | NarrativeText | Other important antigens in the Rh system are C, c, E, and e. These antigens are not usually tested for in rou- tine blood typing tests. However, testing for the presence of these antigens is useful in paternity testing, and when a technologist tries to identify unexpected Rh antibodies | No

11921 | NarrativeText | Unlike the ABO system, antibodies to Rh antigens don’t develop naturally. They develop only as an immune response after a transfusion or during pregnancy. | No
11922 | NarrativeText | The incidence of the Rh blood types varies between racial groups, but not as widely as the ABO blood types: 85% of whites and 90% of blacks are Rh-positive; 15% of whites and 10% of blacks are Rh-negative. | No

Finally, the Rh-negative mother is given an injection of Rh Immunoglobulin (RhIg) at 28 weeks of gestation and again after delivery, if the baby is Rh positive. The RhIg attaches to any Rh-positive cells from the baby in the mother’s bloodstream, preventing them from triggering anti-D antibody production in the mother. An Rh-negative woman should also receive RhIg following a miscarriage, abortion, or ectopic pregnancy. | No
11924 | NarrativeText | In transfusions, the Rh system is next in importance after the ABO system. Most Rh-negative people who receive Rh-positive blood will develop anti-D antibodies. A later transfusion of Rh-positive blood could result in a severe or fatal transfusion reaction. | No
11925 | NarrativeText | Rh incompatibility is the most common and severe cause of HDN. This incompatibility can happen when an Rh-negative woman and an Rh-positive man produce an Rh-positive baby. Cells from the baby can cross the pla- centa and enter the mother’s bloodstream, causing the mother to make anti-D antibodies. Unlike ABO antibod- ies, the structure of anti-D antibodies makes it likely that they will cross the placenta and enter the baby’s blood- stream. There, they can destroy the baby’s red blood cells, causing severe or fatal anemia. | No
11926 | NarrativeText | OTHER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS. Several other blood group systems may be involved in HDN and trans- fusion reactions, although they are much less frequent than ABO and Rh. They are the Duffy, Kell, Kidd, MNS, and P systems. Tests for antigens from these systems are not included in routine blood typing, but they are com- monly used in paternity testing. | No
11927 | NarrativeText | Like Rh antibodies, antibodies in these systems do not develop naturally, but as an immune response after transfusion or during pregnancy. An antibody screening test is done before a crossmatch to check for unexpected antibodies to antigens in these systems. A person’s serum is mixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared cells containing antigens from these systems. If clumping occurs, the antibody is identified. | No
11928 | NarrativeText | The first step in preventing HDN is to find out the Rh types of the expectant parents. If the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, the baby is at risk for devel- oping HDN. The next step is to test the mother’s serum to make sure she doesn’t already have anti-D antibodies from | No
11929 | Title | Crossmatching | No
11930 | NarrativeText | Crossmatching is the final step in pretransfusion testing. It is commonly referred to as compatibility test- ing, or “Type and Cross.” | No
11931 | NarrativeText | Before blood from a donor and the recipient are crossmatched, both are ABO and Rh typed. In addition, antibody screening is done to look for antibodies to cer- tain Rh, Duffy, MNS, Kell, Kidd, and P system antigens. If an antibody to one of these antigens is found, only blood without that antigen will be compatible in a cross- match. This sequence must be repeated before each transfusion a person receives. | No
11932 | NarrativeText | To begin the crossmatch, blood from a donor with the same ABO and Rh type as the rcipient is selected. In a test tube, serum from the patient is mixed with red blood cells from the donor. If clumping occurs, the blood is not compatible; if clumping does not occur, the blood is compatible. If an unexpected antibody is found in either the patient or the donor, the blood bank does fur- ther testing to make sure the blood is compatible. | No
11933 | NarrativeText | In an emergency, when there is not enough time for blood typing and crossmatching, O red blood cells may be given, preferably Rh-negative. O blood type is called the universal donor because it has no ABO antigens for a patient’s antibodies to attack. In contrast, AB blood type is called the universal recipient because it has no ABO antibodies to attack the antigens on transfused red blood cells. If there is time for blood typing, red blood cells of the recipient type (type specific cells) are given. In either case, the crossmatch is continued, even though the trans- fusion has begun. | No
11934 | Title | Preparation | No
11935 | NarrativeText | To collect the 10 mL blood needed for these tests, a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet above the patient’s elbow, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the needle into an attached tube. Collec- tion of the sample takes only a few minutes. | No
11936 | NarrativeText | Blood typing and crossmatching must be done three days or less before a transfusion. A person doesn’t need to change diet, medications, or activities before these tests. He should tell his healthcare provider if, during the last three months, he has received a blood transfusion or a plasma substitute, or has had a radiology procedure using intravenous contrast media. These can give false clump- ing reactions in both typing and crossmatching tests. | No
11937 | Title | Aftercare | No
11938 | NarrativeText | The possible side effects of any blood collection are discomfort or bruising at the site where the needle punc- tured the skin, as well as dizziness or fainting. Bruising is reduced if pressure is applied with a finger to the punc- ture site until the bleeding stops. Discomfort is treated with warm packs to the puncture site. | No
11939 | Title | 534 | No
11940 | Title | Risks | No
11941 | NarrativeText | There are no risks from the blood collection or test procedures. Blood transfusions always have the risk of an unexpected transfusion reaction. A nurse watches a patient for signs of a reaction during the entire transfusion. | No
11942 | Title | Normal results | No
11943 | NarrativeText | There is no normal blood type. The desired result of a crossmatch is that compatible donor blood is found. Com- patibility testing procedures are designed to provide the safest blood product possible for the recipient, but a com- patible crossmatch is no guarantee that an unexpected adverse reaction will not appear during the transfusion. | No

11964 | NarrativeText | The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the level of urea nitrogen in a sample of the patient’s blood. Urea is a substance that is formed in the liver when the body breaks down protein. Urea then circulates in the blood in the form of urea nitrogen. In healthy people, most urea nitrogen is filtered out by the kidneys and leaves the body in the urine. If the patient’s kidneys are not functioning properly or if the body is using large amounts of protein, the BUN level will rise. If the patient has severe liver disease, the BUN will drop. | No

11999 | NarrativeText | Boils and carbuncles are bacterial infections of hair follicles and surrounding skin that form pustules (small blister-like swellings containing pus) around the follicle. Boils are sometimes called furuncles. A carbuncle is formed when several furuncles merge to form a single deep abscess with several heads or drainage points. | No
12000 | Title | Description | No
12001 | NarrativeText | Boils and carbuncles are firm reddish swellings about 0.2-0.4 in (5-10 mm) across that are slightly raised above the skin surface. They are sore to the touch. A boil usually has a visible central core of pus; a carbuncle is larger and has several visible heads. Boils occur most commonly on the face, back of the neck, buttocks, upper legs and groin area, armpits, and upper torso. Carbuncles are less common than single boils; they are most likely to form at the back of the neck. Males are more likely to develop carbuncles. | No

12006 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
12007 | NarrativeText | Boils and carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that causes an infection in an oil gland or hair follicle. Although the surface of human skin is usually resistant to bacterial infection, S. aureus can enter through a break in the skin surface—including breaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or drug injections. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle. | No

It may either continue to swell until the point bursts open and allows the pus to drain, or it may be gradually reabsorbed into the skin. It takes between one and two weeks for a boil to heal completely after it comes to a head and discharges pus. The bacteria that cause the boil can spread into other areas of the skin or even into the bloodstream if the skin around the boil is injured by squeezing. If the infection spreads, the patient will usually develop chills and fever, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), and red lines in the skin running outward from the boil. | No
12012 | NarrativeText | Furunculosis is a word that is sometimes used to refer to recurrent boils. Many patients have repeated episodes of furunculosis that are difficult to treat because their nasal passages carry colonies of S. aureus. These bacterial colonies make it easy for the patient’s skin to be reinfected. They are most likely to develop in patients with diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. | No
12013 | NarrativeText | Carbuncles are formed when the bacteria infect sev- eral hair follicles that are close together. Carbunculosis is a word that is sometimes used to refer to the develop- ment of carbuncles. The abscesses spread until they merge with each other to form a single large area of infected skin with several pus-filled heads. Patients with carbuncles may also have a low-grade fever or feel gen- erally unwell. | No
12014 | Title | Diagnosis | No
12015 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of boils and carbuncles is usually made by the patient’s primary care doctor on the basis of visual examination of the skin. In some cases involving recurrent boils on the face, the doctor may need to con- sider acne as a possible diagnosis, but for the most part boils and carbuncles are not difficult to distinguish from other skin disorders. | No
12016 | NarrativeText | S. aureus can easily be cultured in the laboratory if the doctor needs to rule out inclusion cysts or deep fun- gal infections that gardeners sometimes get. The doctor can make a culture from pus taken from the boil or car- buncle to confirm the diagnosis of a staphylococcal infection. He or she can also culture the patient’s nasal discharge to test for the presence of a S. aureus colony. | No
12017 | Title | Treatment | No
12018 | Title | Patient and family education | No
12019 | NarrativeText | Patient education is an important part of the treatment of boils and carbuncles. Patients need to be warned against picking at or squeezing boils because of the danger of spreading the infection into other parts of the skin or bloodstream. It is especially important to avoid squeezing boils around the mouth or nose because infections in these areas can be carried to the brain. Patients should also be advised about keeping the skin clean, washing their hands carefully before and after touching the boil or carbuncle, avoiding the use of greasy cosmetics or creams, and keep- ing their towels and washcloths separate from those of other family members. Some doctors may recommend an antiseptic soap or gel for washing the infected areas. | No
12020 | NarrativeText | If the patient has had several episodes of furunculo- sis, the doctor may examine family members or close contacts to see if they are carriers of S. aureus. In many cases they also need treatment for boils or carbuncles. Skin infections and reinfections involving small groups or clusters of people are being reported more frequently in the United States. | No
12021 | Title | Medications | No
12022 | NarrativeText | Boils are usually treated with application of antibiot- ic creams—usually clindamycin or polymyxin—follow- ing the application of hot compresses. The compresses help the infection to come to a head and drain. | No
12023 | NarrativeText | Carbuncles and furunculosis are usually treated with oral antibiotics as well as antibiotic creams or oint- ments. The specific medications that are given are usual- ly dicloxacillin (Dynapen) or cephalexin (Keflex). Ery- thromycin may be given to patients who are allergic to penicillin. The usual course of oral antibiotics is 5-10 days; however, patients with recurrent furunculosis may be given oral antibiotics for longer periods. Furunculosis is treated with a combination of dicloxacillin and rifampin (Rifadin). | No

The addition of zinc sup- plements and vitamin A to the diet is reported to be effective in treating boils. The application of a paste or poultice containing goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) root is recommended by naturopaths on the grounds that goldenseal helps to kill bacteria and reduce inflammation. | No

This test may be ordered to deter- mine why a patient’s bones ache or feel sore, or when a mass or deformity is found on an x ray, CT scan, bone scan, or other diagnostic imaging procedure. | No
12060 | Title | Precautions | No
12061 | NarrativeText | The patient’s doctor and the surgeon who performs the bone biopsy must be told about any prescription and over-the-counter medications the patient is taking, and about allergies or reactions the patient has had to anes- thetics or pain relievers. Special care must be taken with patients who have experienced bleeding problems. | No
12062 | Title | Description | No
12063 | NarrativeText | A bone biopsy involves using a special drill or other surgical instruments to remove bone from the patient’s body. The procedure usually lasts about 30 minutes and may be performed in the hospital, a doctor’s office, or a surgical center. | No
12064 | NarrativeText | A drill biopsy is generally used to obtain a small specimen. After the skin covering the bone has been cleansed with an antiseptic and shaved, the patient is given a local anesthetic. The doctor will not begin the procedure until the anesthetic has numbed the area from which the bone is to be removed, but the patient may feel pressure or mild pain when the needle pierces the bone. The surgeon turns the needle in a half-circle to extract a sample from the core, or innermost part, of the bone. The sample is drawn into the hollow stem of the biopsy nee- dle. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it is examined under a microscope. | No
12065 | NarrativeText | An open biopsy is used when a larger specimen is needed. After the area covering the bone has been cleansed with an antiseptic and shaved, the patient is given a general anesthetic. After the anesthetic takes effect and the patient is unconscious, the surgeon makes an incision and removes a bone specimen. The specimen is sent to the laboratory for immediate analysis. Results of that analysis may indicate that additional surgery should be performed right away. | No
12066 | Title | Preparation | No
12067 | NarrativeText | No special preparation is needed for a drill biopsy, but a patient must fast for at least 12 hours before an open biopsy. | No
12068 | Title | Aftercare | No
12069 | NarrativeText | Pain medication will be prescribed after a biopsy, and vital signs will be monitored until they return to nor- mal. Most patients can go home in about an hour. If bone was removed from the spine, the patient may stay in the hospital overnight. The surgical site must be kept clean and dry for 48 hours, and the patient’s doctor should be notified if any of these symptoms appear: * fever * headache | No
12070 | ListItem | * pain on movement + inflammation or pus near the biopsy site | No

12100 | NarrativeText | A bone density test, or scan, is designed to check for osteoporosis, a disease that occurs when the bones become thin and weak. Osteoporosis happens when the bones lose calcium and other minerals that keep them strong. Osteoporosis begins after menopause in many women, and worsens after age 65, often resulting in seri- ous fractures. These fractures may not only bring dis- ability, but may affect longevity. As many as one-fourth of women who fracture their hip after age 50 die within one year. | No
12101 | NarrativeText | Most people today will get a bone density scan from a machine using a technology called Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry or DEXA for short. This machine takes a picture of the bones in the spine, hip, total body and wrist, and calculates their density. If a DEXA machine is not available, bone density scans can also be done with dual photon absorptiometry (measuring the spine, hip and total body) and quantitative computed tomography scans (measuring the spine). Bone density scanners that use DEXA technology to just measure bone density in the wrist (called pDEXA scans) provide scans at some drugstores. Yet these tests are not as accurate as those that measure density in the total body, spine or hip— where most fractures occur. | No

12105 | NarrativeText | A bone density scan measures the strength of an individual’s bones and determines the risk of fracture. An observation of any osteoporosis present can be made. | No
12106 | Title | Description | No
12107 | NarrativeText | To take a DEXA bone density scan, the patient lies on a bed underneath the scanner, a curving plastic arm that emits x rays. These low-dose x rays form a fan beam that rotates around the patient. During the test, the scanner moves to capture images of the patient’s spine, hip or entire body. A computer then compares the patient’s bone strength and risk of fracture to that of other people in the United States at the same age and to young people at peak bone density. Bones reach peak density at age 30 and then start to lose mass. The test takes about 20 minutes to do and is painless. The DEXA bone scan costs about $250. Some insurance companies and Medicare cover the cost. pPDEXA wrist bone scans in drugstores are available for about $30. | No
12108 | Title | Preparation | No
12109 | NarrativeText | The patient puts on a hospital gown and lies on the bed underneath the scanner. Not all doctors routinely schedule this test. If the following factors apply to a patient, they may need a bone density scan and can dis- cuss this with their doctor. The patient: + is at risk for osteoporosis * is near menopause | No

12115 | Title | Normal results | No
12116 | NarrativeText | The patient, when compared with people at “young normal bone density” (called the T-score) has the same or denser bones than a healthy 30-year-old. T scores above 1 mean that a patient has a healthy bone mass. Scores from 0 to —1 mean that the patient has borderline bone mass and should repeat the test in two to five years. | No
12117 | Title | Abnormal results | No

12138 | Title | Purpose | No
12139 | NarrativeText | The drugs described here are used to treat or prevent osteoporosis (brittle bone disease) in women past menopause as well as older men. They also are used pre- scribed for Paget’s disease, a painful condition that weak- ens and deforms bones, and they are used to control calci- um levels in the blood. | No
12140 | NarrativeText | Bone is living tissue. Like other tissue, bone is con- stantly being broken down and replaced with new materi- al. Normally, there is a balance between the breakdown of old bone and its replacement with new bone. But when something goes wrong with the process, bone dis- orders may result. | No
12141 | NarrativeText | Osteoporosis is a particular concern for women after menopause, as well as for older men. In osteo- porosis, the inside of the bones become porous and thin. Over time, this condition weakens the bones and makes them more likely to break. Osteoporosis is four times more common in women than in men. This is because women have less bone mass than men, tend to live longer and take in less calcium, and need the female hormone estrogen to keep their bones strong. If men live long enough, they are also at risk of getting osteo- porosis later in life. Once total bone mass has peaked— around age 35—all adults start to lose it. In women, the rate of bone loss speeds up during menopause, when estrogen levels fall. Bone loss may also occur if both ovaries are removed by surgery. Ovaries make estrogen. Hormone replacement therapy is one approach to preventing osteoporosis. However, not all people can use hormone replacement therapy. Bone disorder drugs are a good alternative for people who already have osteoporosis or who are at risk of developing it. Risk factors include lack of regular exercise, early menopause, being underweight, and a strong family history of osteoporosis. | No
12142 | Title | Description | No
12143 | NarrativeText | Bone disorder drugs are available only with a physician’s prescription and come in tablet, nasal spray, and injectable forms. Commonly used bone dis- order drugs are alendronate (Fosamax), calcitonin (Miacalcin, Calcimar), and raloxifene (Evista). Ralox- ifene belongs to a group of drugs known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which act like estrogen in some parts of the body but not in others. This makes the drugs less likely to cause some of the harmful effects that estrogen may cause. Unlike estro- gen, raloxifene does not increase the risk of breast cancer. In fact, research suggests that raloxifene may even reduce that risk. | No

12157 | NarrativeText | People with low levels of calcium in their blood should not take this medicine. It also is not recommended for women on hormone replacement therapy or for anyone with kidney problems. Before using alendronate, anyone who has digestive or swallowing problems should make sure that his or her physician knows about the condition. | No
12158 | Title | Calcitonin | No
12159 | NarrativeText | Calcitonin nasal spray may cause irritation or small sores in the nose. Check with a physician if this becomes very uncomfortable or if there is bleeding from the nose. | No
12160 | NarrativeText | The injectable form of calcitonin has caused serious allergic reactions in a few people. The nasal spray is not known to cause such reactions, but the possibility exists. Before starting treatment with calcitonin, the physician who prescribes the drug may order an allergy test to make sure there will not be a problem. | No
12161 | Title | Raloxifene | No
12162 | NarrativeText | A rare, but serious side effect of raloxifene is an increased risk of blood clots that form in the veins and may break away and travel to the lungs. This is about as likely in women who take raloxifene as it is in women who take estrogen. Because of this possible problem, women with a history of blood clots in their veins should not take raloxifene. | No
12163 | NarrativeText | Women who have had breast cancer or cancer of the uterus should check with their physicians about whether they can safely use raloxifene. | No
12164 | Title | General precautions for bone disorder drugs | No
12165 | NarrativeText | To keep bones strong, the body needs calcium and vitamin D. Dairy products and fish such as salmon, sar- dines and tuna are good sources of both calcium and vita- min D. People who are taking bone disorder drugs for osteoporosis and who do not get enough of these nutri- ents in their diets should check with their physicians about taking supplements. Other important bone-saving steps are avoiding smoking and alcohol and getting enough of the kind of exercise that puts weight on the bones (such as walking or lifting weights). | No
12166 | NarrativeText | People who are taking these drugs because they have too much calcium in their blood may need to /imit the amount of calcium in their diets. Too much calcium may pre- vent the medicine from working properly. Discuss the proper diet with the physician who prescribed the drug, and do not make any diet changes without the physician’s approval. | No
12167 | NarrativeText | Anyone who has had unusual reactions to bone dis- order drugs in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician also should be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preser- vatives, or other substances. | No
12168 | NarrativeText | Women who are pregnant or who may become preg- nant and women who are breastfeeding should check with their physicians before using this alendronate or cal- citonin. Raloxifene should not be used by women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. In laboratory studies of rats, raloxifene caused birth defects. | No

12199 | NarrativeText | Bone grafting is a surgical procedure by which new bone or a replacement material is placed into spaces between or around broken bone (fractures) or holes in bone (defects) to aid in healing. | No
12200 | Title | Purpose | No
12201 | NarrativeText | Bone grafting is used to repair bone fractures that are extremely complex, pose a significant risk to the patient, or fail to heal properly. Bone graft is also used to help fusion between vertebrae, correct deformities, or provide structural support for fractures of the spine. In addition to fracture repair, bone graft is used to repair defects in bone caused by birth defects, traumatic injury, or surgery for bone cancer. | No
12202 | Title | 544 | No
12203 | Title | Description | No
12204 | NarrativeText | Bone is composed of a matrix, mainly made up of a protein called collagen. It is strengthened by deposits of calcium and phosphate salts, called hydroxyapatite. Within and around this matrix are located the cells of the bones, which are of four types. Osteoblasts produce the bone matrix. Osteocytes are mature osteoblasts and serve to maintain the bone. Osteoclasts break down and remove bone tissue. Bone lining cells cover bone sur- faces. Together, these four types of cells are responsible for building the bone matrix, maintaining it, and remod- eling the bone as needed. | No
12205 | NarrativeText | There are three ways in which a bone graft can help repair a defect. The first is called osteogenesis, the for- mation of new bone by the cells contained within the graft. The second is osteoinduction, a chemical process in which molecules contained within the graft (bone morphogenetic proteins) convert the patient’s cells into cells that are capable of forming bone. The third is osteo- conduction, a physical effect by which the matrix of the graft forms a scaffold on which cells in the recipient are able to form new bone. | No
12206 | NarrativeText | New bone for grafting can be obtained from other bones in the patient’s own body (e.g., hip bones or ribs), called autograft, or from bone taken from other people that is frozen and stored in tissue banks, called allograft. A variety of natural and synthetic replacement materials are also used instead of bone, including collagen (the protein substance of the white fibers of the skin, bone, and connective tissues); polymers, such as silicone and some acrylics; hydroxyapatite; calcium sulfate; and ceramics. A new material, called resorbable polymeric grafts, is also being studied. These resorbable grafts pro- vide a structure for new bone to grow on; the grafts then slowly dissolve, leaving only the new bone behind. | No
12207 | NarrativeText | To place the graft, the surgeon makes an incision in the skin over the bone defect and shapes the bone graft or replacement material to fit into the defect. After the graft is placed into the defect, it is held in place with pins, plates, or screws. The incision is closed with stitches and a splint or cast is used to prevent movement of the bones while healing. | No
12208 | NarrativeText | The costs associated with a bone graft vary. These costs include: the surgeon’s fee (variable); anesthesiolo- gist’s fees (averaging $350 to $400 per hour); hospital charges (averaging $1,500 to $1,800 per day, more for intensive care or private rooms); medication charges ($200 to $400); and additional charges, including an assisting surgeon, treatment of complications, diagnostic procedures (e.g., blood work or x rays), medical sup- plies, and equipment use. The cost for the graft itself can range from $250 to $900. | No
12209 | NarrativeText | This procedure is covered by many third-party insur- ers; insurance coverage should be explored for each indi- vidual case. | No
12210 | Title | Aftercare | No
12211 | NarrativeText | The time required for convalescence for fractures or spinal fusion may vary from one to 10 days, and vigor- ous exercise may be limited for up to three months. | No
12212 | NarrativeText | Most bone grafts are successful in helping the bone defect to heal. The extent of recovery will depend on the size of the defect and the condition of the bone sur- rounding the graft at the time of surgery. Severe defects may take some time to heal and may require further attention after the initial graft. In one study of over 1,000 patients who received very large allografts after surgery for bone cancer, researchers found that approxi- mately 85% of the patients were able to return to work or normal physical activities without using crutches. However, about 25% of these patients required a second operation, because the first did not heal properly. Less severe bone defects, though, should heal completely without serious complications. | No
12213 | Title | Risks | No
12214 | NarrativeText | The risks for any surgical procedure requiring anes- thesia include reactions to the medications and breathing problems. The risks for any surgical procedure include bleeding and infection. | No
12215 | NarrativeText | The drawbacks of autografts include: the additional surgical and anesthesia time (typically 30 minutes per procedure) to obtain, or harvest, the bone for grafting; added costs of the additional surgery; pain and infection that might occur at the site from which the graft is taken; and the relatively small amount of bone that is available for grafting. | No
12216 | NarrativeText | The drawbacks of allografts include: variability between lots, since the bone is harvested from a variety of donors; the bone may take longer to incorporate with the host bone than an autograft would; the graft may be less effective than an autograft; and the possibility of transferring diseases to the patient. Other complications may result from the immune response mounted by the patient’s immune system against the grafted bone tissue. With the use anti-rejection agents (drugs to combat rejection of grafted bone tissue) immune rejection is less of a problem. | No

12247 | Title | Definition | No
12248 | NarrativeText | Bone growth stimulation is the technique of promot- ing bone growth in difficult to heal fractures by apply- ing a low electrical current or ultrasound to the fracture. | No
12249 | Title | Purpose | No
12250 | NarrativeText | Bone growth stimulation is done when satisfactory healing is not occurring naturally or when the pace of healing is too slow. This condition is called fracture nonunion, and it occurs more frequently among adults than children, in people with severe or complex fractures, and in people who smoke. | No
12251 | NarrativeText | The theory behind applying an electric current to fractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact that the concave side of the bone becomes negatively charged and the convex side is positively charged. It is believed that artificially encouraging this charging with an electric current will speed healing. In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved the application of low intensity ultrasound pulses as a treat- ment for fracture nonunion. | No
12252 | NarrativeText | Ultrasound and electromagnetic stimulation are expensive and are used only when healing problems exist for a substantial length of time. Each method must be used for at least three to six months to be effective. | No
12253 | Title | Precautions | No
12254 | NarrativeText | Bone growth stimulation cannot be used if the gap between the ends of the fracture is too large. | No
12255 | Title | Description | No
12256 | NarrativeText | Electric stimulation can be applied either from the inside of the body (invasively) or from the outside the body (noninvasively). Ultrasound is a noninvasive pro- cedure. The type of stimulation selected depends on the doctor’s preference, the type and location of the fracture, and the patient’s motivation to comply with the treat- ment schedule. Treatment can take anywhere from three to six months. | No
12257 | Title | 546 | No
12258 | Title | nvasive stimulators | No
12259 | NarrativeText | Invasive electric stimulators are either fully or partial- ly implantable. The advantage of these devices is that they apply a direct electric current to the fracture 24 hours a day. The fully implantable stimulator requires little daily attention from the patient. Patients using a semi-implanted stimulator must regulate their own treatment schedule and have to care for the external power pack. The disadvantage of implantable and semi-implantable stimulators is that their implantation is a surgical procedure. | No
12260 | NarrativeText | Fully implantable direct current stimulators are installed in a hospital under general or regional anesthesia. Both the stimulator and the power source are implanted. The surgeon makes an incision and places a spiral shaped cathode inside the bone. A wire leads to the power source and a small anode. The power source is a battery pack that is implanted in the nearby muscle. The body transmits electrical current to close the circuit. The incision is then closed. Once in place, the device provides continuous direct electric current for bone growth stimulation. | No
12261 | NarrativeText | Partially implanted stimulators use cathode pins that are implanted at the edge of each bone that is fractured. Wires lead to the surface of the skin where a power source and the anode are located. Wires complete the cir- cuit. The external portion of the device is held in place by acast. This source of stimulation also runs continuously. | No
12262 | Title | Noninvasive stimulators | No
12263 | NarrativeText | In the noninvasive stimulator, external electromag- netic coils are placed on either side of the fracture and are held in place by a strap or cuff. Locating the coils correctly is important, and their location relative to the fracture is usually confirmed by x rays. | No
12264 | NarrativeText | The coils produce a pulsating electromagnetic field. It is up to the patient to maintain the prescribed treatment schedule. Effective treatment requires stimulation any- where from three to ten hours each day in periods of no less than one hour. | No
12265 | NarrativeText | Ultrasound stimulation is the most recent treatment for stimulating bone growth. A device that generates low intensity pulses of sound is applied to the skin over the fracture. The advantage of this technique is that it is non- invasive and the period of application of the sound pulses can be as short as 20-30 minutes each day. The results of this treatment have been studied less than the effect of electromagnetic stimulation. | No
12266 | Title | Preparation | No
12267 | NarrativeText | Bone growth stimulation is done only when healing has failed to occur for many months. Before it is started, | No
12268 | NarrativeText | x rays are done of the fracture area. If the device is to be implanted, standard preoperative blood and urine tests are done. The patient may meet with an anesthesiologist to discuss any conditions that might affect the adminis- tration of anesthesia. | No
12269 | Title | Aftercare | No
12270 | NarrativeText | If a noninvasive, pulsating, electromagnetic field device is used, the patient must not put any stress or weight on the fracture until it is healed, which is a matter of months in most cases. In all lower limb fractures, regardless of the stimulation method used, the patient can not bear weight on the limb with the fracture until heal- ing is complete. This limits the patient’s mobility for many months. Patients have the responsibility for regu- larly making sure that the unit works and caring for external devices and the casts that hold them in place. | No
12271 | Title | Risks | No
12272 | NarrativeText | Noninvasive devices have few risks associated with them. The main risk associated with implantable devices is the development of infection at the site of implantation. | No
12273 | Title | Normal results | No
12274 | NarrativeText | Success in healing a fracture nonunion using bone growth stimulation depends on the type, location, and severity of the fracture and the age and general health of the patient. | No

12291 | Title | Precautions | No
12292 | NarrativeText | Allergies or previous adverse reactions to medica- tions should be discussed with the doctor. Any current medications, including herbal or nutritional supplements, should be evaluated for the potential to interfere with proper coagulation (clot formation). These would include coumadin, aspirin, and other agents used as blood thin- ners. Caution should be used when the herbs gingko, gin- ger, garlic, or ginseng have been utilized as supplements, due to a risk of bleeding. | No

12296 | Title | Description | No
12297 | NarrativeText | Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be per- formed by a physician or nurse clinician. Each proce- dure takes about 20 to 30 minutes and is usually per- formed on an outpatient basis, but can be done in a hos- pital if necessary. | No
12298 | NarrativeText | The skin covering the biopsy site is cleansed with an antiseptic, and the patient may be given a mild sedative. A local anesthetic is administered. The hematologist or nurse clinician performing the procedure will not begin until the anesthetic has numbed the area from which the specimen is to be extracted. In both adults and children, aspiration and biopsy are most commonly performed on the rear bone of the hip (posterior iliac crest). In adults, sampling from the sternum (breastbone) is sometimes done. The latter location is technically easier, but is somewhat more painful for the patient and presents the risk of heart injury. On rare occasions, a long bone of the leg (tibia) may be used as a sample site for an infant. | No
12299 | NarrativeText | In a bone marrow aspiration, a special needle is inserted beneath the skin and rotated until it penetrates the cortex, or outer covering of the bone. At least half a teaspoon of marrow is withdrawn from the bone by a syringe attached to the needle. The patient may experi- ence discomfort when the needle is inserted or when the marrow is aspirated. If more marrow is needed, the nee- dle is repositioned slightly, a new syringe is attached, and a second sample is taken. The samples are transferred from the syringes to slides and vials, then sent to a labo- ratory for analysis. | No
12300 | NarrativeText | Bone marrow biopsy may be performed immediately before or after bone marrow aspiration. The procedure uti- lizes a special large-bore needle that is used to drill out a core of marrow. In bone marrow biopsy, the needle is inserted, rotated from side to side, withdrawn, and reinsert- ed at a different angle. This procedure is repeated if needed until a small core, about 0.4 inches (1 cm) long, is separat- ed from the bone marrow. The needle is again removed, and a piece of fine wire threaded through its tip transfers the specimen onto sterile gauze. The patient may feel dis- comfort or pressure when the needle is inserted and experi- ence a brief, pulling sensation when the marrow is with- drawn. Unlike aspiration specimens, which are smeared, these samples contain structurally intact bone marrow. Microscopic examination can show what material its cells | No

12303 | Title | Preparation | No
12304 | NarrativeText | A current history and physical are obtained from the patient, along with proper consent. The patient is gener- ally placed in a prone position (lying face down) for preparation, and local anesthetic, with or without seda- tion, is administered. | No
12305 | Title | Aftercare | No
12306 | NarrativeText | After the needle is removed, the biopsy site will be covered with a clean, dry bandage. Pressure is applied to control bleeding. The patient’s pulse, breathing, blood pressure, and temperature are monitored until they return to normal, and the patient may be instructed to remain in a supine position (lying face up) for half an hour before getting dressed. | No
12307 | NarrativeText | The patient should be able to leave the clinic and resume normal activities immediately. Patients who have received a sedative often feel sleepy for the rest of the day; driving, cooking, and other activities that require clear thinking and quick reactions should therefore be avoided. | No
12308 | NarrativeText | The biopsy site should be kept covered and dry for several hours. Walking or taking prescribed pain medica- tions usually ease any discomfort felt at the biopsy site, and ice can be used to reduce swelling. | No

12343 | Title | Definition | No
12344 | NarrativeText | The bone marrow—the sponge-like tissue found in the center of certain bones—contains stem cells that are the precursors of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. These blood cells are vital for normal body functions, such as oxygen transport, defense against infection and disease, and clotting. Blood cells have a limited lifespan and are constantly being replaced; there- fore, healthy stem cells are vital. | No
12345 | NarrativeText | In association with certain diseases, stem cells may produce too many, too few, or otherwise abnormal blood cells. Also, medical treatments may destroy stem cells or alter blood cell production. The resultant blood cell abnormalities can be life threatening. | No
12346 | NarrativeText | Bone marrow transplantation involves extracting bone marrow containing normal stem cells from a healthy donor, and transferring it to a recipient whose body cannot manufacture proper quantities of normal blood cells. The goal of the transplant is to rebuild the recipient’s blood cells and immune system and hopefully cure the underlying ailment. | No
12347 | Title | Purpose | No
12348 | NarrativeText | A person’s red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets may be destroyed or may be abnormal due to disease. Also, certain medical therapies, particularly chemotherapy or radiation treatment, may destroy a person’s stem cells. The consequence to a person’s health is severe. Under normal circumstances, red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body and remove carbon dioxide from the body’s tissues. White blood cells form the cornerstone of the body’s immune system and defend | No
12349 | Title | 550 | No
12350 | NarrativeText | it against infection. Platelets limit bleeding by enabling the blood to clot if a blood vessel is damaged. | No
12351 | NarrativeText | A bone marrow transplant is used to rebuild the body’s capacity to produce these blood cells and bring their numbers to normal levels. IlInesses that may be treated with a bone marrow transplant include both can- cerous and noncancerous diseases. | No
12352 | NarrativeText | Cancerous diseases may or may not specifically involve blood cells; but, cancer treatment can destroy the body’s ability to manufacture new blood cells. Bone mar- row transplantation may be used in conjunction with additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, for various types of leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease, lymphoma, breast and ovarian cancer, and other cancers. Noncancerous diseases for which bone marrow transplantation can be a treatment option include aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and severe immunodeficiency. | No
12353 | Title | Precautions | No
12354 | NarrativeText | Bone marrow transplants are not for everyone. Transplants are accompanied by a risk of infection, trans- plant rejection by the recipient’s immune system, and other complications. The procedure has a lower success rate the greater the recipient’s age. Complications are exacerbated for people whose health is already seriously impaired as in late-stage cancers. Therefore, a person’s age or state of health may prohibit use of a bone marrow transplant. The typical cut-off age for a transplant ranges from 40 to 55 years; however, a person’s general health is usually the more important factor. | No
12355 | NarrativeText | Even in the absence of complications, the transplant and associated treatments are hard on the recipient. Bone marrow transplants are debilitating. A person’s ability to withstand the rigors of the transplant is a key considera- tion in deciding to use this treatment. | No
12356 | Title | Description | No
12357 | Title | Autologous and allogeneic transplants | No
12358 | NarrativeText | Two important requirements for a bone marrow transplant are the donor and the recipient. Sometimes, the donor and the recipient may be the same person. This type of transplant is called an autologous transplant. It is typically used in cases in which a person’s bone marrow is generally healthy but will be destroyed due to medical treatment for diseases such as breast cancer and Hodgkin’s disease. Most bone marrow transplants are autologous. If a person’s bone marrow is unsuitable for an autologous transplant, the bone marrow must be derived from another person in an allogeneic transplant. | No
12359 | NarrativeText | Allogeneic transplants are more complicated because of proteins called human lymphocyte antigens (HLA) that are on the surface of bone marrow cells. If the donor and the recipient have very dissimilar antigens, the recipient’s immune system regards the donor’s bone marrow cells as invaders and launches a destructive attack against them. Such an attack negates any benefits offered by the transplant. | No
12360 | Title | HLA matching | No
12361 | NarrativeText | There are only five major HLA classes or types— designated HLA—A,-B, —C,—D, and class [1]—but much variation within the groupings. For example, HLA-A from one individual may be similar to, but not the same as, HLA-A in another individual; such a situation can render a transplant from one to the other impossible. | No
12362 | NarrativeText | HLA matching is more likely if the donor and recip- ient are related, particularly if they are siblings; however, an unrelated donor may be a potential match. Only in rare cases is matching HLA types between two people not an issue: if the recipient has an identical twin. Identi- cal twins carry the same genes; therefore, the same anti- gens. A bone marrow transplant between identical twins is called a syngeneic transplant. | No
12363 | Title | Peripheral blood stem cell transplants | No
12364 | NarrativeText | A relatively recent development in stem cell trans- plantation is the use of peripheral blood cells instead of stem cells from bone marrow. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) are obtained from circulating blood rather than from bone marrow, but the amount of stem cells found in the peripheral blood is much smaller than the amount of stem cells found in the bone marrow. Peripheral blood stem cells can be used in either autologous or allogeneic transplants. The majority of PBSC transplants are autolo- gous. However, recent clinical studies indicate that PBSCs are being used more frequently than bone mar- row for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. | No
12365 | NarrativeText | The advantages of PBSC transplants when compared to bone marrow transplants are: in allogeneic transplanta- tion, haematopoietic and immune recovery are faster with PBSCs which reduces the potential for disease recur- rence, primarily graft-versus-host-disease. In autologous transplantation, the use of PBSCs can result in faster blood count recoveries. Also, some medical conditions exist in which the recipient cannot accept bone marrow stem cell transplants, but can accept PBSC transplants. Some possible disadvantages to PBSC transplant versus bone marrow transplantation are: so much more fluid vol- ume is necessary to collect enough PBSCs that, at the time of infusing the new stem cells into the recipient, the fluid can collect in the lungs or cause temporary kidney problems. Also, the time commitment for the donor for a PBSC transplant is considerable. When the PBSCs are In autologous bone marrow transplantation, stem cells are collected from the patient. Once the patient has undergone chemotherapy, the cells are replaced in the blood via an intra- venous catheter. The cells return to the bone marrow and begin producing healthy new cells.

12367 | Title | The transplant procedure | No
12368 | NarrativeText | BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. The bone mar- row extraction, or harvest, is the same whether for an autol- ogous or allogeneic transplant. Harvesting is done under general anesthesia (i.e., the donor sleeps through the proce- dure), and discomfort is usually minimal afterwards. Bone marrow is drawn from the iliac crest (the part of the hip bone to either side of the lower back) with a special needle and a syringe. Several punctures are usually necessary to collect the needed amount of bone marrow, approximately 1-2 quarts (0.9-1.91). (This amount is only a small percent- age of the total bone marrow and is typically replaced with- in four weeks.) The donor remains at the hospital for 24-48 hours and can resume normal activities within a few days. | No
12369 | NarrativeText | If the bone marrow is meant for an autologous trans- plant, it is stored at -112 to -320°F (-80 to —196°C) until it is needed. Bone marrow for an allogeneic transplant is sometimes treated to remove the donor’s T cells (a type of white blood cell) or to remove ABO (blood type) anti- gens; otherwise, it is transplanted without modification. | No

12391 | NarrativeText | PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION. Before collection for a PBSC transplant, donors receive daily four injections of the drug G-CSF, or filgrastim. (Patients can give it to themselves at home if need be.) These pretreatments stimulate the body to release stem cells into the blood. After these pretreatments, the donors’ experience is similar to that of a whole blood donor’s experience—PBSC donors’ blood is collected at a clinic or hospital as an outpatient procedure. The differ- ences are that several sessions will be needed over days or weeks and the blood is collected in a process called apheresis. The blood travels from one arm into a blood cell separator that removes only the stem cells, and the rest of the blood is returned back to the donor, in the other arm. The cells are then frozen for later use. | No

In preparation for receiv- ing the transplant, the recipient undergoes “conditioning”—a preparative regimen in which the bone marrow and abnor- A two- to four—week waiting period follows the mar- row transplant before its success can begin to be judged. The marrow recipient is kept in isolation during this time to minimize potential infections. The recipient also receives antibiotic medications and blood and platelet transfusions to help fight off infection and prevent exces- sive bleeding. Further side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, can be treated with other medications. Once blood counts are normal and the side effects of the trans- plant abate, the recipient is taken off antibiotics and usu- ally no longer needs blood and platelet transfusions. | No
12417 | NarrativeText | Following discharge from the hospital, the recipient is monitored through home visits by nurses or out-patient vis- its for up to a year. For the first several months out of the hospital, the recipient needs to be careful in avoiding potential infections. For example, contact with other people who may be ill should be avoided or kept to a minimum. Further blood transfusions and medications may be neces- sary, but barring complications, the recipient can return to normal activities about 6-8 months after the transplant. | No
12418 | Title | Risks | No
12419 | NarrativeText | Bone marrow transplants are accompanied by seri- ous and life-threatening risks. Furthermore, they are not always an absolute assurance of a cure for the underlying ailment; a disease may recur in the future. Approximate- ly 30% of people receiving allogeneic transplants do not survive. Autologous transplants have a much better sur- vival rate—nearly 90%—but are not appropriate for all types of ailments requiring a bone marrow transplant. Furthermore, they have a higher failure rate with certain diseases, specifically leukemia. | No
12420 | NarrativeText | In the short term, there is the danger of pneumonia or other infectious disease, excessive bleeding, or liver disorder caused by blocked blood vessels. The transplant may be rejected by the recipient’s immune system, or the donor bone marrow may launch an immune-mediated attack against the recipient’s tissues. This complication is called acute graft versus host disease, and it can be a life- threatening condition. Characteristic signs of the disease include fever, rash, diarrhea, liver problems, and a com- promised immune system. | No
12421 | NarrativeText | Approximately 25-50% of bone marrow transplant recipients develop long-term complications. Chronic graft versus host disease symptoms include skin changes such as dryness, altered pigmentation, and thickening; abnormal liver function tests; dry mouth and eyes; infections; and weight loss. Other long-term complications include cataracts (due to radiation treatment), abnormal lung func- tion, hormonal abnormalities resulting in reduced growth or hypothyroidism, secondary cancers, and infertility. | No

12446 | NarrativeText | A bone scan is a diagnostic procedure used to evalu- ate abnormalities involving bones and joints. A radioac- tive substance is injected intravenously, and the image of its distribution in the skeletal system is analyzed to detect certain diseases or conditions. | No
12447 | Title | Purpose | No
12448 | NarrativeText | Bone scans are most frequently ordered to check whether a cancer that originated elsewhere has spread to the bones. Cancers which begin in the breasts, kidneys, lungs, prostate, thyroid, or urinary bladder are most like- ly to spread, or metastasize, to the bones. If metastases are found, periodic bone scans may be ordered to see if therapy is effective against a cancer. | No
12449 | NarrativeText | Some cancers arise in bone. These are called primary bone cancers. When an abnormality is found on an x ray of a bone, a bone scan may be helpful in deciding if it is a pri- mary bone cancer, or a non-cancerous (benign) condition. | No
12450 | NarrativeText | Infection in the bone (osteomyelitis) can be detected or confirmed by a bone scan, often days or weeks before an x ray would reveal it. Bone scans are useful in diag- nosing early arthritic changes, and monitoring both the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treat- ment. Unexplained pain may be evaluated with a bone scan, because it can demonstrate fractures which are dif- ficult to detect on x ray. Bone scans can be used to see if artificial joints have loosened or become infected. Sus- pected child abuse may be evaluated with a bone scan, due to its ability to see an overall pattern of repeated trauma. Abnormalities caused by altered circulation to the bone may be diagnosed with a bone scan. ue9s auldipaw seajonu auog | No

12453 | Title | Description | No
12454 | NarrativeText | This test is performed in a radiology facility, either in a hospital department or an outpatient x-ray center. The patient usually sits or lies down while a radioactive substance is injected through a vein in the arm. For a bone scan, the radionuclide used is specifically chosen to accumulate in the bone. The patient then waits from three to four hours, for the substance to collect within the skeletal system. During this time, he or she will be instructed to drink several glasses of water. Patients are free to get up and move around as they desire during this waiting time, and should urinate frequently. Just before the scanning begins, the patient should empty his or her bladder again. This ensures that a lot of radioactive mate- rial is not concentrated in the urinary bladder, which could obscure part of the pelvic bones. | No
12455 | NarrativeText | During the scan, the patient lies on his or her back on a table, but may be repositioned to the stomach or side during the study. It is important for the patient not to move, except when directed to by the technologist. | No
12456 | NarrativeText | The radionuclide scanner, sometimes called a gamma camera, or scintillation camera, is positioned against the body part to be examined. Either the camera, the table, or both, may change position during the study. For a total body bone scan, the patient is scanned from head to foot, over a period of 30-60 minutes. Patients should experience no discomfort from this examination. | No

12463 | NarrativeText | Another variation is called a three-phase, or three- stage, bone scan. The procedure is the same, except the scanning takes place immediately after the radioactive substance is injected, approximately 20 minutes after the injection, then two to four hours later. | No
12464 | Title | Preparation | No
12465 | NarrativeText | Some specialized blood studies should be drawn before this study is begun. Jewelry or metallic objects need to be removed. No other special physical prepara- tion is required. | No
12466 | NarrativeText | The patient should understand that there is no dan- ger of radioactive exposure to themselves or others, as only small amounts of the radioisotope are used. The total dose of radiation absorbed is minimal, often less than the amount received from ordinary x rays. The radionuclide scanner does not emit any radiation at all, but detects and records it from the patient. | No

12487 | Title | Precautions | No
12488 | NarrativeText | Precautions should be taken to protect patients from unnecessary exposure to radiation. Patients should be shielded with lead aprons as much as possible. Women of childbearing age who could be pregnant should not have x rays of their trunk or pelvic regions. The fetus is espe- cially at risk during the first trimester of pregnancy. Women who are pregnant should not have x rays of their pelvic region, lumbar spine, and abdomen unless absolutely necessary. If other types of x rays are neces- sary, a lead apron should be used to shield the abdominal and pelvic regions. | No
12489 | Title | Description | No
12490 | NarrativeText | X rays are a common diagnostic test in which a form of energy called x-ray radiation penetrates the patient’s body. In bone x rays, electrical current passes through an x-ray tube and produces a beam of ionizing radiation that passes through the bone(s) being examined. This produces a picture of the inside of the body on film. The physician reads the developed x ray on a wall-mounted light box. | No
12491 | NarrativeText | Digital x rays are a new type of x ray in which con- ventional equipment is used to take the x ray but the image is produced via computer. In a digital x ray, the image is created on a reusable plate. After being read by a laser reader, the information is sent in digital form to a storage unit connected to a computer network from which the radiologist reads the x ray. An electronic report can then be sent to the patient’s physician. | No
12492 | NarrativeText | Problems with bones that x rays can detect result from injury or from disease caused by a malfunction in the patient’s bone chemistry. Bone injuries, especially broken bones (fractures), are common and can be accurately diagnosed by bone x rays. X rays are espe- cially helpful in diagnosing simple and incomplete frac- tures which can’t be detected during a physical exami- nation. X rays can also be used to check for bone posi- tion in a fracture. Some bone diseases can be definitive- ly diagnosed with bone x rays while others require additional tests. | No
12493 | NarrativeText | Osteoporosis, a common bone disease, can be detect- ed in bone x rays but other tests are then ordered to deter- mine the extent of the disease. For osteomalacia and rick- ets, a blood test and x rays of the affected bone are usually definitive; in some cases a bone biopsy (microscopic analysis of a small ammount of tissue) is also done. In a rare bone disease called Paget’s disease, x rays may be used in conjunction with bone, blood, and urine tests to make a diagnosis. In another rare bone disease, fibrous dysplasia, bone x rays or a bone biopsy (microscopic analysis of a small amount of tissue) are used to confirm the diagnosis. Bone x rays are definitive in diagnosing osteogenesis imperfecta. For osteomyelitis, bone x rays are used in conjunction with a blood test, bone scan, or needle biopsy to make the diagnosis. For arthritis, x rays of the bone are occasionally used in conjunction with blood tests. In bone tumors, bone x rays are helpful but they may not be definitive. | No
12494 | NarrativeText | Bone x rays are performed by a technician or radiol- ogist, and interpreted by a radiologist. They are taken in a physician’s office, radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or diagnostic clinic. Bone x rays generally take less than 10 minutes. There is no pain or discomfort associated with the test, but some people find it difficult to remain still. The results are often available in minutes. | No
12495 | NarrativeText | During the test, the patient lies on a table. The tech- nician taking the x ray will check the patient’s position- ing and place the x-ray machine over the part of the body being examined. After asking the patient to remain motionless, he or she steps out of the area and presses a button to take the picture. | No

12500 | Title | Risks | No
12501 | NarrativeText | The human body contains some natural radiation and is also exposed to radiation in the environment. There is a slight risk from exposure to radiation during bone x rays, however, the amount of radiation is small and the risk of harm is very low. If reproductive organs are exposed to radiation, genetic alterations may occur. Excessive or repeated doses of radiation can cause changes in other types of body tissue. No radiation remains in the body after the x ray. | No

The first therapeu- tic use of Botox was in the treatment of strabismus (eyes are unable to direct towards the same object) and since then it has been used to treat a variety of involuntary muscle contractions or disorders. Its cosmetic use is the result of treatment for facial spasms where smoothing of facial lines was reported by patients. In general, 90% of injections for facial spasms are resolved satisfactorily. | No

12548 | NarrativeText | Additional side effects may include excessive mus- cle weakness at the injection site or adjacent muscles. These effects typically resolve quickly. Occasionally, patients report flu-like symptoms but they are usually self-limited. | No
12549 | NarrativeText | A certain percentage of patients may also experience resistance to the toxin. The presence of circulating anti- bodies to the toxin is presumed to be the primary reason for resistance to Botox injections. Patients who have lit- tle reaction to Botox ‘A’ may benefit from injections using one of the other six serotypes. Using the smallest effective dose limits the likelihood of immunoresistance in unresponsive patients. | No

12551 | NarrativeText | The anticipated outcome of Botox injections is relaxation of the target muscle tissue. The pharmacologi- cal effects of botulinum toxin are typically isolated to local areas and do not result in tissue destruction or pro- longed paralysis. Varying the dose can deliver a precise amount of toxin to achieve graded degrees of paralysis for the desired level of response. | No

12561 | NarrativeText | Botulism is caused by botulinum toxin, a natural poison produced by certain bacteria in the Clostridium genus. Exposure to the botulinum toxin occurs mostly from eating contaminated food, or in infants, from cer- tain clostridia growing in the intestine. Botulinum toxin blocks motor nerves’ ability to release acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that relays nerve signals to muscles, and flaccid paralysis occurs. As botulism progresses, the muscles that control the airway and breathing fail. | No
12562 | Title | Description | No
12563 | NarrativeText | Botulism occurs rarely, but it incites concern because of its high fatality rate. Clinical descriptions of botulism possibly reach as far back in history as ancient Rome and Greece. However, the relationship between contaminated food and botulism wasn’t defined until the late 1700s. In 1793 the German physician, Justinius Kerner, deduced that a substance in spoiled sausages, which he called wurstgift (German for sausage poison), caused botulism. The toxin’s origin and identity remained elusive until Emile von Ermengem, a Belgian professor, isolated Clostridium botulinum in 1895 and identified it as the poison source. | No
12564 | NarrativeText | Three types of botulism have been identified: food- borne, wound, and infant botulism. The main difference between types hinges on the route of exposure to the toxin. In the United States, there are approximately 110 cases of botulism reported annually. Food-borne botu- lism accounts for 25% of all botulism cases and can be traced to eating contaminated home-preserved food. Infant botulism accounts for 72% of all cases, but the recovery rate is good (about 98%) with proper treatment. | No
12565 | NarrativeText | Though domestic food poisoning is a problem world-wide, there has been a growing concern regarding the use of botulism toxin in biological warfare and terror- ist acts. The Iraqi government admitted in 1995 that it had loaded 11,200 liters of botulinum toxin into SCUD missiles during the Gulf War. Luckily, these special mis- siles were never used. As of 1999, there were 17 coun- tries known to be developing biological weapons, includ- ing the culture of botulism toxins. | No
12566 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
12567 | Title | Causes | No
12568 | NarrativeText | Toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botu- linum is the main culprit in botulism. Other members of the clostridium genus can produce botulinum toxin, namely C. argentinense, C. butyricum, and C. baratii, but they are minor sources. To grow, these bacteria require a low-acid, oxygen-free environment that is warm (40- 120°F or 4.4-48.8°C) and moist. Lacking these condi- tions, the bacteria transform themselves into spores that, like plant seeds, can remain dormant for years. Clostridia and their spores exist all over the world, especially in soil and aquatic sediments. They do not threaten human or animal health until the spores encounter an environment that favors growth. The spores then germinate, and the growing bacteria produce the deadly botulism toxin. | No
12569 | NarrativeText | Scientists have discovered that clostridia can produce at least seven types of botulism toxin, identified as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Humans are usually affected by A, B, E, and very rarely F. Domesticated animals such as dogs, cat- tle, and mink are affected by botulism C toxin, which also affects birds and has caused massive die-offs in domestic bird flocks and wild waterfowl. Botulism D toxin can cause illness in cattle, and horses succumb to botulism A, B, and C toxin. There have been no confirmed human or animal botulism cases linked to the G toxin. | No
12570 | NarrativeText | In humans, botulinum toxin latches onto specific proteins in nerve endings and irreversibly destroys them. These proteins control the release of acetyl- choline, a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle cells. With acetylcholine release blocked, nerves are not able to stimulate muscles. Ironically, botulinum toxin has found a beneficial niche in the world of med- icine due to this action. Certain medical disorders are characterized by involuntary and uncontrollable mus- cle contractions. Medical researchers have discovered that injecting a strictly controlled dose of botulinum toxin into affected muscles inhibits excessive muscle contractions. The muscle is partially paralyzed and normal movement is retained. | No
12571 | Title | Symptoms | No
12572 | ListItem | * Food-borne. Food that has been improperly preserved or stored can harbor botulinum toxin-producing clostridia. Botulism symptoms typically appear within 18-36 hours of eating contaminated food, with extremes of four hours to eight days. Initial symptoms include blurred or double vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking. Possible gastrointestinal problems include constipation, nausea, and vomiting. As botulism progresses, the vic- tim experiences weakness or paralysis, starting with the head muscles and progressing down the body. Breathing becomes increasingly difficult. Without medical care, respiratory failure and death are very likely. | No
12573 | ListItem | Infant. Infant botulism was first described in 1976. Unlike adults, infants younger than 12 months are vul- nerable to C. botulinum colonizing the intestine. Infants ingest spores in honey or simply by swallowing spore- containing dust. The spores germinate in the large intestine and, as the bacteria grow, they produce botu- linum toxin that is absorbed into the infant’s body. The first symptoms include constipation, lethargy, and poor feeding. As infant botulism progresses, sucking and swallowing (thus eating) become difficult. A nursing mother will often notice breast engorgement as the first sign of her infant’s illness. The baby suffers overall weakness and cannot control head movements. Because of the flaccid paralysis of the muscles, the baby appears “floppy.” Breathing is impaired, and death from respira- tory failure is a very real danger. | No
12574 | ListItem | Wound. Confirmed cases of wound botulism have been linked to trauma such as severe crush injuries to the extremities, surgery, and illegal drug use. Wound botu- lism occurs when clostridia colonize an infected wound and produce botulinum toxin. The symptoms usually appear four to 18 days after an injury occurs and are similar to food-borne botulism, although gastrointesti- nal symptoms may be absent. | No
12575 | Title | Diagnosis | No
12576 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of botulism can be tricky because symp- toms mimic those presented by other diseases. Botulism may be confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome, myas- thenia gravis, drug reactions, stroke, or nervous system infection, intoxications (e.g. carbon monoxide or atropine), or shellfish poisoning. Sepsis is the most com- mon initial diagnosis for infant botulism. Failure to thrive may also be suspected. Some reports have linked infant botulism to 5-15% of sudden infant death syn- drome (SIDS, crib death) cases. Laboratory tests are used for definitive diagnosis, but if botulism seems like- ly, treatment starts immediately. | No

12595 | NarrativeText | Aside from antitoxin, no drugs are used to treat botu- lism. Antibiotics are not effective for preventing or treating botulism. In fact, antibiotic use is discouraged for infants because dying bacteria could potentially release more toxin into a baby’s system. Antibiotics can be used, however, to treat secondary respiratory tract and other infections. | No
12596 | NarrativeText | Adults with botulism are treated with an antitoxin derived from horse serum that is distributed by the Cen- ters for Disease Control and Prevention. The antitoxin (effective against toxin types A, B, and E) inactivates only the botulinum toxin that is unattached to nerve end- ings. Early injection of antitoxin (usually within 24 hours of onset of symptoms) can preserve nerve endings, pre- vent progression of the disease, and reduce mortality. | No

12604 | Title | Prognosis | No
12605 | NarrativeText | With medical intervention, botulism victims can recover completely, albeit slowly. It takes weeks to months to recover from botulism, and severe cases can take years before a total recovery is attained. Recovery depends on the nerve endings building new proteins to replace those destroyed by botulinum toxin. | No
12606 | Title | Prevention | No
12607 | NarrativeText | Vaccines against botulism do not exist to prevent infant botulism or other forms of the disease. Food safety is the surest prevention for botulism. Botulinum toxin cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted, so the wisest course is to discard any food that seems spoiled without tasting it. Home canners must be diligent about using sterile equipment and following U.S. Department of Agriculture canning guidelines. If any part of a canned food container is rusty or bulging, the food should not be eaten. Infant botulism is difficult to prevent, because controlling what goes into an infant’s mouth is often beyond control, especially in regard to spores in the air. One concrete preventative is to never feed honey to infants younger than 12 months since it is one known source of botulism spores. As infants begin eating solid foods, the same food precautions should be followed as for adults. | No

12623 | Title | Purpose | No
12624 | NarrativeText | The ultimate goal of bowel preparation is priming the bowel for a diagnosis procedure (using x rays to detect a disease process in the intestines) or for surgical interven- tion (such as removal of polyps, cancer, or narrowing of the intestinal diameter). Colonoscopy is an effective treatment procedure for polyps (a growing mass of tis- sue). This procedure enables visualization of the entire large bowel. During a colonoscopy, polyps can be cauter- ized (applying an electric current which incinerates the polyp). The procedure can be both diagnostic and thera- peutic. A sigmoidoscopy scope is a flexible tube that allows clinicians to view the sigmoid colon (the part of the large intestine before the rectum). This procedure is important for detection of colon/rectal cancer. It is safe, quick to perform (usually 30-45 minutes in about 90% of cases), and an effective diagnostic tool for evaluation of: + rectal bleeding + other studies that showed an abnormality | No

12632 | NarrativeText | The bowel is emptied of any contents for procedures such as barium enema (introducing a barium containing chemical to promote better visualization of intestines during x rays) or colonoscopy. Preparation of the bowel distally—from the rectum—is necessary for diagnostic procedures such as sigmoidoscopy. Prior to surgical pro- cedures bowel preparation is recommended to decrease the possibility of developing more medical problems. Patients may also be given a course of antibiotics to pre- vent the possibility of infection. | No

In order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient may be placed on a low residue diet for several days prior to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at least the day before surgery, with nothing taken by mouth after midnight. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations (GoLytely or Colyte), may be ordered to empty the bowel of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacteria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infection. A nasogastric tube is inserted through the nose into the stomach on the day of surgery or during surgery. This removes the gastric secretions and prevents nausea and vomiting.

12699 | ListItem | * One of the most common causes of constipation is the laxative habit. Repeated artificial stimulation of the bowels destroys their natural emptying reflex, so that they will no longer move without artificial stimulants. The laxative habit begins innocently enough with the correct belief that bowels should move every day, how- ever, laxatives will cause the evacuation of several days worth of stool in a single movement. Impatient for stool to reaccumulate for the necessary few days, the patient takes another laxative, and the cycle begins. | No
12700 | ListItem | The other major cause of constipation is a diet with insufficient bulk or roughage. The bowel works more smoothly the more contents it has. Western diets of highly refined foods have eliminated most of the residue from food. The result is that most food is absorbed, leav- ing little to pass through and be excreted as feces. | No
12701 | ListItem | * Constipation occurs acutely with impaction—the pres- ence in the rectum of a mass of feces too large to pass. | No
12702 | NarrativeText | Fecal impaction is usually the result of poor bowel habits, a diet with too little liquid and roughage, and inadequate physical activity. | No
12703 | ListItem | ¢ Diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, can disrupt the bowel’s normal rhythm and lead to irregularity. | No
12704 | ListItem | * Several diseases of the nervous system affect bowel reflexes. | No
12705 | Title | Description | No
12706 | NarrativeText | Bowel training reestablishes the bowel’s normal reflexes by repeating a routine until it becomes a habit. Naturally the patient must be able and willing to cooper- ate. Some patients are so convinced they need daily laxa- tives that they are afraid to do without them. It takes time for a changed diet to effect the bowels and for the bowel to regain its normal rhythm. Trust and patience are necessary. | No
12707 | NarrativeText | After gaining the patient’s cooperation, the next step is to optimize the diet. Healthy bowel movements require ingestion of a large amount of liquids and bulk foods. The patient should drink two to three quarts of liquids every day, with liberal inclusion of prune juice and per- haps coffee for their natural laxative effect. Bulk comes from unrefined foods. Oat bran, wheat bran, brown rice, green vegetables, apples, and pears are a few examples of high residue foods. Many patients will benefit from adding bulk preparations of psyllium. Constipating foods like bananas and cheese should be avoided until a natural rhythm is well established. | No
12708 | NarrativeText | To assure that stools are soft enough to pass easily, it is a good idea to add a pure stool softener like DOSS (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), two to four per day as needed. DOSS also helps prevent impaction. | No
12709 | NarrativeText | There is usually a time of day when bowel move- ments are more likely to occur. In anticipation of this time, the patient should participate in activities that stim- ulate a normal bowel movement. Walking, eating unre- fined foods, and drinking prune juice or coffee, encour- age natural evacuation. It is acceptable to use lubricants such as glycerine suppositories or oil enemas at this time. For severe constipation, water enemas may be needed to initiate a movement. | No
12710 | NarrativeText | It is also important for the patient to recognize the urge to defecate and to respond right away to that urge. The longer stool sits in the rectum, the more water the rectum will absorb from it, making it harder and more difficult to pass. | No

12729 | Title | Description | No
12730 | NarrativeText | The brain is usually well insulated from infection by bacteria, protected by the skull, the meninges (tissue lay- ers surrounding the brain), the immune system, and the highly regulated barrier between the bloodstream and the brain. Under certain circumstances, however, bacteria can invade the brain and cause a localized infection called an abscess. Brain abscess is relatively rare, accounting for 1 in 10,000 hospital admissions. Single abscess occurs in 75% of cases, and the remainder of cases involve multiple abscesses. If not treated, brain abscess is almost always fatal. | No
12731 | Title | 566 | No
12732 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
12733 | NarrativeText | One-half of all brain abscesses are caused by the spread of bacteria from a nearby infection. Sources of bacteria include: * middle ear infections (otitis media) or infections in the bony spaces in front of the middle ear (mastoiditis) | No
12734 | ListItem | + sinus infections * an abscessed tooth. | No
12735 | NarrativeText | Other sources of bacteria include: + lung infections ¢ abdominal infection | No

12737 | ListItem | * penetrating head wounds * neurosurgery | No
12738 | NarrativeText | Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or the presence of another immune deficiency greatly increases the risk of brain abscess. Approximately 25% of cases have no detectable cause of infection. | No
12739 | NarrativeText | Brain abscess can be caused by a variety of organ- isms, many of them related to ear and sinus infections. Many times brain abscess cases are caused by two or more bacteria. In 30-60% of cases, the bacteria combina- tion includes streptococci, microorganisms that can live without oxygen (anaerobes), and enterobacteria. A small number of cases are caused by yeast, fungi, and single- cell organisms (protozoa). | No
12740 | NarrativeText | The symptoms of brain abscess often develop slow- ly, usually within a period of about two weeks. The most common symptoms are: * headache * neurologic symptoms related to the specific part of the brain that is infected | No
12741 | ListItem | + altered mental status * seizures | No
12742 | NarrativeText | Fever and stiff neck occur in less than one-third of cases. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, eye tremor (nystagmus), poor balance, and uncoordinated movements. | No
12743 | Title | Diagnosis | No
12744 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of brain abscess is performed by using a computed tomography scan (CT) or a magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) scan to determine the site of infection. Tissue removal (biopsy) is usually performed as well. A biopsy is performed to determine the type of bacterium involved. Biopsies can also be used to rule out tumor or other noninfectious localized lesions, which may look the same on the scans. | No
12745 | NarrativeText | Other tests are performed to determine the source of the infection. These tests include blood cultures, x rays of the chest, and a physical exam of the ears, sinuses, and teeth. A test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is usually also performed. | No
12746 | Title | Treatment | No
12747 | NarrativeText | Treatment for brain abscess begins with intravenous antibiotics, chosen to match the infecting bacterium if known, or to cover a wide spectrum of possibilities if not. Treatment usually continues for six to eight weeks. | No
12748 | NarrativeText | Aspiration surgery is almost always done to drain the abscess. In this procedure, a needle is guided to the infect- ed site by CT scan, and fluid is removed (aspirated) from the abscess. Aspiration may be repeated several times until the bacteria are completely killed or removed. Surgi- cal removal of infected or dead tissue may be needed in some cases. For patients with many sites of infection, aspiration or surgical removal is not done because of the increased difficulty and risk of the procedure. For these patients, antibiotic therapy alone is used. Steroid treat- ment is controversial, but may be indicated in some cases. | No
12749 | Title | Prognosis | No
12750 | NarrativeText | Even with prompt treatment, brain abscess is fatal in about 20% of cases. About half of those who survive have some residual neurological problems, including seizures in many patients. | No
12751 | NarrativeText | There are several reasons why patients with brain abscess can have a poor prognosis. The illness may not be diagnosed correctly or an accurate diagnosis may take additional time. The patient may receive an antibiotic that does not match the infecting organism. Sometimes the infection may not be limited to a definite area in the brain, making diagnosis and treatment difficult. The small number of cases caused by fungal infection may take additional time to diagnose. A patient may also have a poor prognosis because there is more than one abscess, the location of the abscess may be deep within the brain, or the infection may have moved into many locations within the brain. Severe complications can result from brain abscess, including comma and brain rupture. In 80- 100% of cases involving brain rupture, the patient dies. | No
12752 | Title | Prevention | No
12753 | NarrativeText | Brain abscess may be preventable by prompt and aggressive treatment of the infections which give rise to it, especially sinus and ear infections. | No

12803 | NarrativeText | A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in the brain. Unlike other tumors, brain tumors spread by local extension and rarely metastasize (spread) outside the brain. A benign brain tumor is composed of non-cancer- ous cells and does not metastasize beyond the part of the brain where it originates. A brain tumor is considered malignant if it contains cancer cells, or if it is composed of harmless cells located in an area where it suppresses one or more vital functions. | No
12804 | Title | Description | No
12805 | NarrativeText | Each year, more than 17,000 brain tumors are diag- nosed in the United States. About half of all primary brain tumors are benign, but in life-threatening locations. The rest are malignant and invasive. | No
12806 | Title | Benign brain tumors | No
12807 | NarrativeText | Benign brain tumors, composed of harmless cells, have clearly defined borders, can usually be completely removed, and are unlikely to recur. Benign brain tumors do not infiltrate nearby tissues but can cause severe pain, permanent brain damage, and death. Benign brain tumors sometimes become malignant. | No
12808 | Title | Malignant brain tumors | No
12809 | NarrativeText | Malignant brain tumors do not have distinct borders. They tend to grow rapidly, increasing pressure within the brain (ICP) and can spread in the brain or spinal cord beyond the point where they originate. It is highly unusu- al for malignant brain tumors to spread beyond the cen- tral nervous system (CNS). | No

12820 | NarrativeText | Brain tumors can develop at any age, but are most common in children between the ages of 3-12, and in adults aged 55-65. Primary brain cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death between birth and the age of 34, and the fourth most common cause of can- cer death in men aged 35-54. Primary tumors of the brain and central nervous system are often associated with HIV infection. Men and caucasians have a higher risk of devel- oping brain tumors. Other risk factors being studied include children with a history of previous radiation treat- ment to the head for cancer; parents with certain cancers (nervous system, salivary gland, colon); having an older father; having well-educated parents; occupational expo- sure to vinyl chloride, lead, and pesticides; history of epilepsy; history of certain genetic conditions (tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, von Hippel Lindau, famil- ial polyposis, Osler-Weber-Rendu, Li-Fraumeni). | No
12821 | Title | Naming and grading brain tumors | No
12822 | NarrativeText | The name of a brain tumor describes where it origi- nates, how it grows, and what kind of cells it contains. A tumor in an adult is also graded or staged according to: + how malignant it is * how rapidly it is growing and how likely it is to invade other tissues | No
12823 | ListItem | * how closely its cells resemble normal cells. (The more abnormal a tumor cell looks, the faster it is likely to grow) | No
12824 | NarrativeText | Low-grade brain tumors usually have well-defined borders. Some low-grade brain tumors form or are enclosed (encapsulated) in cysts. Low-grade brain tumors grow slowly, if at all. They may spread through- out the brain, but rarely metastasize to other parts of the body. | No
12825 | NarrativeText | Mid-grade and high-grade tumors grow more rapid- ly than low-grade tumors. Described as “truly malig- nant,” these tumors usually infiltrate healthy tissue. The growth pattern makes it difficult to remove the entire tumor, and these tumors recur more often than low-grade tumors. | No
12826 | NarrativeText | A single brain tumor can contain several different types of cells. The tumor’s grade is determined by the highest-grade (most malignant) cell detected under a microscope, even if most of the cells in the tumor are less malignant. An infiltrating tumor is a tumor of any grade that grows into surrounding tissue. | No
12827 | Title | Types of brain tumors | No
12828 | NarrativeText | Glioma is the term used to refer to the most preva- lent primary brain tumors. Gliomas arise from glial tis- sue, which supports and nourishes cells that send mes- sages from the brain to other parts of the body. These tumors may be either malignant or benign. Astrocy- tomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas are three of the most common gliomas. | No
12829 | NarrativeText | ASTROCYTOMAS. Named for the star-like shape of their cells, astrocytomas can develop on any part of the brain or spinal cord. Non-infiltrating astrocytomas grow slowly, and rarely spread to nearby tissue. Mild-to-mod- erately anaplastic astrocytomas with well-differentiated borders do not grow as slowly as non-infiltrating astrocy- tomas, and they do spread to surrounding tissues. | No
12830 | NarrativeText | Anaplastic astrocytomas, which are also called Grade III astrocytomas, look more abnormal and grow more rapidly than non-infiltrating or mild-to-moderately anaplastic tumors. | No
12831 | NarrativeText | Grade IV astrocytomas are also called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. Accounting for 30% of all primary brain tumors, GBMs are the most common brain tumors in middle-aged adults. GBMs are the most malig- nant of all brain tumors. Because they contain a greater mixture of cells than any other brain tumor, they are the most difficult to treat. | No
12832 | NarrativeText | EPENDYMOMAS. Also called ependymal tumors, ependymomas account for 9% of all gliomas, and 5% of all intracranial tumors. These tumors, which are most common in children and adolescents, begin in the very thin membranes that help form cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and line the brain cavities (ventricles) that contain it. | No
12833 | NarrativeText | Ependymomas are usually benign, have well-differ- entiated borders, resemble normal cells, and grow very slowly. The cells of anaplastic (malignant) ependymo- mas look abnormal and grow more rapidly than the cells of benign tumors. | No
12834 | NarrativeText | MIXED GLIOMAS. These heterogeneous tumors con- tain elements of astrocytomas and ependymomas and/or oligodendrogliomas. These are rare tumors that usually occur in middle-aged adults, grow slowly, and do not usually spread beyond the part of the brain where they originate. Mixed gliomas behave like tumors composed of the highest-grade cells they contain. | No
12835 | Title | Non-glial brain tumors | No
12836 | NarrativeText | The most common brain tumors that do not develop from glial cells are medulloblastomas, meningiomas, and Schwannomas. | No
12837 | Title | 570 | No
12838 | NarrativeText | MEDULLOBLASTOMAS. Scientists once thought medulloblastomas (MDLs) developed from glial cells. These fast-growing, malignant tumors are now believed to originate in developing cells not normally present in the body after birth. They are sometimes called primitive neurodectal tumors (PNET). | No
12839 | NarrativeText | MDL tumors are most common in children and are more common in boys than in girls. Only 30% of MDL tumors occur in adults. MDL tumors usually originate in the cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls coordination and some muscle activity), and are often carried to other parts of the brain by cerebrospinal fluid. MDL tumors rarely metastasize beyond the brain and spinal cord. | No
12840 | NarrativeText | MENINGIOMAS. Meningiomas, which represent more than 20% of all primary brain tumors, originate in the membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord (meninges). These tumors are usually benign and most often occur in women aged 30-50 years old. Menin- giomas grow so slowly that the brain can sometimes become accustomed to their presence. Meningiomas compress, rather than invade, brain tissue and may grow to be quite large before any symptoms appear. | No
12841 | NarrativeText | SCHWANNOMAS. Schwannomas originate in the Schwann cells. These cells produce myelin, material that protects the acoustic nerve, which controls hearing. These benign tumors are twice as common in women as in men, and are most often diagnosed in patients between the ages 30-60. | No
12842 | NarrativeText | Schwannomas grow very slowly, and many people adapt to the slight hearing loss and balance problems that are the tumors’ earliest symptoms. A pear-shaped Schwannoma can cause sudden or gradual loss of hear- ing in an ear. As the tumor progresses, it can press on the nerves that control movement and feeling in the face, and cause headaches and facial numbness or tingling. The patient may have trouble walking, swallowing, or con- trolling eye movements, and the sense of taste can be affected. A Schwannoma that grows large enough to press on the brainstem can be deadly. | No
12843 | NarrativeText | CHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMORS. Brain tumors that occur in children are described as supratentorial (in the upper part of the brain) or infratentorial (in the lowest part of the brain). Astrocytomas and ependymomas are common supratentorial tumors. Infratentorial tumors include medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, and ependy- momas. | No
12844 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
12845 | NarrativeText | The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown, but people who work with rubber and certain chemicals have a greater-than-average risk of developing them. There is no evidence that head injury causes brain tumors, but researchers are trying to determine the relationship, if any, between brain tumors and viruses, family history, and long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields. | No
12846 | NarrativeText | Symptoms do not usually appear until the tumor grows large enough to displace, damage, or destroy deli- cate brain tissue. When that happens, the patient may experience: * headaches that become increasingly painful and are most painful when lying down * nausea and vomiting or sudden attacks of vomiting not accompanied by nausea | No
12847 | ListItem | * seizures ¢ dizziness, loss of coordination or balance | No

12852 | Title | Diagnosis | No
12853 | NarrativeText | Although brain tumor symptoms resemble those of many other illnesses, the presence of a brain tumor may be indicated by: * persistent headaches with vomiting or convulsions * progressive deterioration of sight, speech, hearing, touch; or deterioration in the ability to use an arm, hand, foot, or leg | No
12854 | NarrativeText | When a patient experiences one or more of the above symptoms, a primary care physician will perform a complete physical examination, take a detailed med- ical history, and conduct a basic neurologic examination to evaluate: + balance and coordination + abstract thinking and memory | No
12855 | ListItem | * eye movements hearing, touch, and sense of smell | No

12858 | NarrativeText | If the results of these examinations suggest a patient may have a brain tumor, a neurologist recommends some or all of these additional diagnostic tests: * computed tomography scan (CT scan) to reveal brain abnormalities * magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect tumors beneath the bones of the skull | No
12859 | ListItem | * complex imaging techniques such as Positron emis- sion tomography (PET scan), Single photon emission tomography (SPECT scan) | No

12869 | NarrativeText | Surgery is the treatment of choice for accessible brain tumors, which can be removed without causing serious neurologic damage. The procedure most often performed is a craniotomy, but the goals of any type of brain tumor surgery include: *removing as much of the tumor as possible (called debulking the tumor) | No
12870 | ListItem | * removing tumor tissue for microscopic analysis + allowing neurosurgeons to see exactly how the tumor is situated and how it is growing | No
12871 | ListItem | * creating an entry channel for chemotherapy drugs and forms of radiation that are implanted in the brain Depending on the type of brain tumor, its location, and its size, a number of different techniques may be used to surgically remove it. Surgical techniques include: + classic operation | No
12872 | ListItem | + laser microsurgery (uses high temperatures to vaporize tumor cells * ultrasonic aspiration (uses ultrasound waves to break up the tumor into smaller bits which can be “vacuumed” out | No
12873 | NarrativeText | Before undergoing brain surgery, patients are often given: * steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue * snticonvulsant medications to prevent or control seizures | No
12874 | Title | 572 | No
12875 | NarrativeText | + radiation treatments to reduce tumor size Patients whose benign brain tumors can be com- pletely removed may not require any additional treat- ment, but periodic physical and neurologic examinations and CT or MRI scans are sometimes recommended to determine whether the tumor has returned. Because sur- geons cannot be sure that every bit of an infiltrating or metastasizing tumor has been removed, radiation and chemotherapy are used to eradicate cells that may have escaped the scalpel. | No
12876 | NarrativeText | If a tumor cannot be completely removed, removing a portion of it (debulking) can alleviate the patient’s symptoms, enhance the sense of well-being, and increase the effectiveness of other treatments. | No
12877 | Title | Radiation therapy | No
12878 | NarrativeText | External radiotherapy, generally delivered on an out- patient basis, directs radiation to the tumor and the area around it. Implant radiation therapy involves placing tiny pieces of radioactive material in the brain. Left in place permanently, or for a short time, these radioactive pellets release measured doses of radiation each day. This tech- nique is called brachytherapy. Patients are usually hospi- talized during the several days the pellets are most active. | No
12879 | NarrativeText | Stereoactic radiosurgery involves fitting the patient with a frame to stabilize the head, using imaging tech- niques to determine the exact location of tumor cells, and using a sophisticated instrument to administer radiation precisely to that point. Instruments used for delivery of radiation include the gamma knife, adapted linear accel- erator (LINAC), and cyclotron. | No
12880 | NarrativeText | A variety of drugs may also be given during radia- tion therapy, to protect brain cells from the effects of radiation (radioprotective drugs), to increase the sensitiv- ity of tumor cells to radiation (radiosensitizers), or to boost radiation’s effects (radioenhancers). | No
12881 | Title | Chemotherapy | No
12882 | NarrativeText | One or more cancer-killing drugs may be taken by mouth or injected into a blood vessel, muscle, or the cere- brospinal fluid. Chemotherapy may be used with radia- tion and surgery as part of a patient’s initial treatment, or used alone to treat tumors that recur in the same place or in another part of the body. The usual chemotherapy regi- men for a brain tumor is a combination approach, most commonly using procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine. | No
12883 | NarrativeText | New methods of delivering chemotherapy are being used as well. These include: + interstitial chemotherapy is performed at the time of surgery. A chemotherapy-soaked wafer is placed in the cavity left after tumor removal. | No
12884 | ListItem | + Intrathecal chemotherapy instills the medications right into the spinal fluid. | No
12885 | ListItem | ¢ Intraarterial chemotherapy uses tiny catheter tubes to delivery high-dose chemotherapy directly into the arter- ies of the brain. | No
12886 | ListItem | + Potentially toxic chemotherapy drugs can be wrapped in special biologic envelopes called liposomes, to allow the drugs to be delivered to the tumor without adversely affecting other healthy tissues along the way. | No
12887 | ListItem | ¢ Electrochemotherapy uses electric voltage to transport chemotherapy agents into the brain. | No
12888 | NarrativeText | When a young child has a brain tumor, chemotherapy is often used to eliminate or delay the need for radiation. | No
12889 | Title | Other treatments | No
12890 | NarrativeText | If a brain tumor cannot be cured, treatment is designed to make the patient as comfortable as possible and preserve as much of his neurologic functioning as possible. The patient’s doctor may prescribe: * analgesics to relieve pain * anticancer drugs to limit tumor growth | No
12891 | ListItem | * anticonvulsants to control seizures * steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue | No
12892 | Title | Potential therapies | No
12893 | NarrativeText | Scientists are studying ways to empower chemother- apy drugs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (which protects the CNS by separating the brain from blood cir- culating throughout the body), and attack cancer cells that have infiltrated tissue inside it. Agents under investi- gation include both mannitol and substances called receptor-mediated permeabilizers Brain tumor researchers are also investigating: + Less invasive surgical procedures. | No
12894 | ListItem | * Monoclonal antibodies, which pair antibodies with radioactive substances. The antibodies are directed to find and attach to tumor cells, at which time the radioactive substance kills the tumor cell. | No
12895 | ListItem | + Interleukin and interferon, which are substances pro- duced naturally by the human immune system which seem to kill tumor cells. Scientists seek to produce these substances in the laboratory and incorporate their use in brain tumor treatment. | No
12896 | ListItem | ¢ T-lymphocytes, which are also produced normally by the human immune system, and are being used to inject directly into the tumor location during surgery and to infuse into the bloodstream after surgery, in the hopes that they will boost the immune system’s ability to fight tumor cells. | No

12901 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
12902 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments have not been shown to cure brain tumors and should never be substituted for conven- tional therapy. However, complementary therapies (used with, not instead of, standard treatments) can help some patients cope with the stress of their illness and side effects of their treatment. | No
12903 | NarrativeText | Biofeedback can teach patients to influence and control heart rate, muscle tension, and other stress-relat- ed body functions. Some patients claim that guided imagery (visualization) helps them feel healthier and more in control of their disease. | No
12904 | NarrativeText | Massage, meditation, and reflexology help some patients relax; while yoga is said to soothe the body, spir- it, and mind. Hydrotherapy uses ice, liquid, and steam to improve circulation and relieve pain. Therapeutic touch practitioners say they can relieve pain and other symptoms by moving their hands in slow, rhythmic motions several inches above the patient’s body. | No
12905 | NarrativeText | Botanical therapies, homeopathic treatment, tradi- tional Chinese medicine treatments, nutritional focuses on diet and supplements, and detoxification can also be incorporated as complementary therapies. | No
12906 | Title | Prognosis | No
12907 | NarrativeText | The patient’s prognosis depends on where the tumor is located, what type of cells it contains, the size of the tumor, and the effect its already had on adjacent brain structures. A patient whose tumor is discovered early and removed completely may make a full recovery, but the surgery itself can harm or destroy normal brain tissue and cause: * problems with thought, speech, and coordination * seizures | No

12950 | NarrativeText | A breast biopsy is removal of breast tissue for exam- ination by a pathologist. This can be accomplished surgi- cally, or by withdrawing tissue through a needle. | No
12951 | Title | Purpose | No
12952 | NarrativeText | A biopsy is recommended when a significant abnormality is found, either on physical examination and/or by an imaging test. Examples of abnormality can include a breast lump felt during physical self examina- tion or tissue changes noticed from a mammogram test. Before a biopsy is performed, it is important to make sure that the threat of cancer cannot be disproved or ruled out by a simpler, less invasive examination. A lump may be obviously harmless when examined by ultrasound. If this is not decisive, the presence of cancer or a variety of benign breast conditions can be deter- mined using a biopsy. | No
12953 | Title | Precautions | No
12954 | NarrativeText | The type of biopsy recommended should be consid- ered. This will depend on whether the area can be felt, how well it can be seen on mammogram or ultrasound, and how suspicious it feels or appears. Specialized equipment is needed for different types of biopsy and availability may vary. Generally, needle biopsy is less invasive than surgical biopsy. It is appropriate for most, but not all situations. However, some surgeons feel it is far less accurate. | No
12955 | Title | Description | No
12956 | Title | Surgical biopsy | No
12957 | NarrativeText | If an abnormality is not felt during a self examina- tion, there are signs that indicate the need for medical attention. These include: * severe breast pain ¢ changes in the size of a breast or the nipple | No
12958 | ListItem | ¢ changes in the shape of both breast or nipple * pitting, dumpling or redness of the breast skin | No
12959 | ListItem | ¢ nipple redness, irritation, or inversion * changes in the pattern of veins visible on the surface of the breast | No
12960 | ListItem | * some types of nipple discharge If the abnormality is not felt, a needle localization must be done before the actual surgery. After local anes- thetic is administered, a fine wire is placed in the area of concern. Either x ray or ultrasound guidance is used. The patient is awake and usually sitting up. | No
12961 | NarrativeText | There are two types of breast biopsy considered here, excisional and incisional. An excisional biopsy is a surgical procedure, where the entire area of concern and some surrounding tissue is removed. It is usually done as an outpatient procedure, in a hospital or free standing surgery center. The patient may be awake, and is some- times given medication to make her drowsy. The area to be operated on is numbed with local anesthetic. Infre- quently, general anesthesia is used. | No
12962 | NarrativeText | An excisional biopsy itself usually takes under one hour. The total amount of time spent at the facility depends on the type of anesthesia used, whether a needle localization was done, and the extent of the surgery. | No
12963 | NarrativeText | If a mass is very large, an incisional biopsy may be performed. In this case only a portion of the area is removed and sent for analysis. The procedure is the same as an excisional biopsy in other respects. | No
12964 | Title | Needle biopsy | No
12965 | NarrativeText | A needle biopsy removes part of the suspicious area for examination. There are two types, aspiration biopsy (using a fine needle), and large core needle biopsy. Either of these may be called a percutaneous needle biopsy. Per- cutaneous refers to a procedure done through the skin. | No
12966 | NarrativeText | A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin nee- dle to withdraw fluid and cells that can be studied. It can be done in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital. Local anesthetic may be used, but is sometimes withheld, as it may be more painful than the biopsy needle. The area to place the needle may be located by touch. No specialized equipment is needed. However, using ultrasound guid- ance enables the physician to feel and see the lesion at the same time. The actual withdrawing of fluid and cells can be visualized as it occurs. This helps ensure that the specimen is taken from the right place. | No
12967 | NarrativeText | A large core needle biopsy uses a larger diameter needle to remove small pieces of tissue, about the size of a grain of rice. It can be done in a clinic or hospital that has the appropriate facilities. Local anesthetic is routine- Subcutaneous fatty tissue Areola Lactiferous duct Tumor Excisional biopsy Lobule of gland Fine needle aspiration biopsy A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to withdraw fluid and cells from the breast to be examined. An exci- sional biopsy is a surgical procedure in which the entire area of concern and some surrounding tissue is removed for analy- sis. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.) | No
12968 | NarrativeText | ly used. Ultrasound or x ray is used for guidance of a large core needle biopsy. | No
12969 | NarrativeText | If the suspicious area is seen best with x ray, a stereo- tactic device is used. This means that x rays are taken from several angles. This information is fed into a computer, which analyzes the data and guides the needle to the correct place. The patient may be sitting up, or she may be lying on her stomach, with her breast positioned through an opening in the table. The breast is held firmly, but comfortably between a plastic paddle and a metal plate, similar to those used for mammograms (a set of x rays taken of the front and side of the breast). X rays may be taken before, during, and after the tissue is drawn into the needle, to confirm that the correct spot is biopsied. This procedure may also be referred to as a stereotactic core biopsy, or a mammotomy. | No
12970 | NarrativeText | the operation. This will typically be from midnight the night before, if general anesthesia is planned. No food restrictions are necessary for needle biopsy. It is advis- able to eat lightly before the procedure. This is especially important if the patient will be lying on her stomach for a stereotactic biopsy. | No
12971 | Title | Aftercare | No
12972 | NarrativeText | After a surgical biopsy, the incision will be closed with stitches, and covered with a bandage. The bandage can usually be removed in one or two days. Stitches are taken out approximately one week afterward. Depending on the extent of the operation, normal activities can be resumed in approximately one to three days. Vigorous exercise may be limited for one to three weeks. | No
12973 | NarrativeText | Ultrasound is used to guide needle placement for some lesions. The patient lies on her back or side. After the area is numbed, sterile gel is applied. The physician places a transducer, an instrument about the size of an electric shaver, over the skin. This produces an image from the reflection of sound waves. A special needle, usually in a spring loaded device, is used to obtain the tissue. The pro- cedure is observed on a monitor as it is happening. | No
12974 | NarrativeText | The skin opening for a needle biopsy is minimal. It may be closed with thin, clear tape, called a steri strip, or covered with a bandaid and a small gauze bandage. The patient can return to her usual routine immediately after the biopsy. Strenuous activity or heavy lifting is not rec- ommended for 24 hours. Any bandages can be removed one or two days after the biopsy. | No
12975 | Title | Risks | No
12976 | Title | Preparation | No
12977 | NarrativeText | A surgical breast biopsy may require the patient to have nothing to eat or drink for a period of time before Infection is always a possibility when the skin is broken, although this rarely occurs. Redness, swelling, or severe pain at the biopsy site would indicate a possible | No
12978 | Title | 576 | No
12979 | NarrativeText | infection. Another possible consequence of a breast biop- sy is a hematoma. This is a collection of blood at the biopsy site. It is usually absorbed naturally by the body. If it is very large and uncomfortable, it may need to be drained. A surgical breast biopsy may produce a visible scar on the breast. Sometimes this may make future mammograms harder to interpret accurately. | No
12980 | NarrativeText | A false negative pathology report is another risk. This means that no cancer was found when a cancer was present. The incidence of this varies with the biopsy technique. In general, fine needle aspiration biopsies have the highest rate of false negative results, but there may be variation in results between facilities. | No
12981 | Title | Normal results | No
12982 | NarrativeText | A normal pathology report indicates no malignancy is present. The tissue sample may be further classified as a benign breast condition, such as tumor of the breast (fibroadenoma) or connective tissue that resembles fiber (fibrosis). Studies have demonstrated that approxi- mately 80% of all breast biopsies result in a benign pathology report. | No
12983 | Title | Abnormal results | No
12984 | NarrativeText | An abnormal pathology report indicates a cancer is present. If a fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed, the pathologist has viewed individual cells under a microscope to see if they appear cancerous. Large core needle biopsy and surgical biopsy will be able to give more information. This includes the type of cancer, whether it has invaded surrounding tissue, and how likely it is to spread quickly. There are some conditions which are not malignant but indicate high risk for future devel- opment of breast cancer. If these are identified, more frequent monitoring of the area may be recommended. | No

13003 | NarrativeText | Breast cancer is caused by the development of malignant cells in the breast. The malignant cells origi- nate in the lining of the milk glands or ducts of the breast (ductal epithelium), defining this malignancy as a cancer. Cancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled division leading to abnormal growth and the ability of these cells to invade normal tissue locally or to spread throughout the body, in a process called metastasis. | No
13004 | Title | Description | No
13005 | NarrativeText | Breast cancer arises in the milk-producing glands of the breast tissue. Groups of glands in normal breast tis- sue are called lobules. The products of these glands are secreted into a ductal system that leads to the nipple. Depending on where in the glandular or ductal unit of the breast the cancer arises, it will develop certain character- istics that are used to sub-classify breast cancer into types. The pathologist will denote the subtype at the time of evaluation with the microscope. Ductal carcinoma begins in the ducts, lobular carcinoma has a pattern involving the lobules or glands. The more important clas- sification is related to the evaluated tumor’s capability to | No
13006 | Title | 577 | No
13007 | NarrativeText | invade, as this characteristic defines the disease as a true cancer. The stage before invasive cancer is called in situ, meaning that the early malignancy has not yet become capable of invasion. Thus, ductal carcinoma in situ is considered a minimal breast cancer. | No
13008 | Title | How breast cancer spreads | No
13009 | NarrativeText | The primary tumor begins in the breast itself but once it becomes invasive, it may progress beyond the breast to the regional lymph nodes or travel (metastasize) to other organ systems in the body and become systemic in nature. Lymph is the clear, protein-rich fluid that bathes the cells throughout the body. Lymph will work its way back to the bloodstream via small channels known as lymphatics. Along the way, the lymph is filtered through cellular sta- tions known as nodes, thus they are called lymph nodes. Nearly all organs in the body have a primary lymph node group filtering the tissue fluid, or lymph, that comes from that organ. In the breast, the primary lymph nodes are under the armpit, or axilla. Classically, the primary tumor begins in the breast and the first place to which it is likely to spread is the regional lymph nodes. Cancer, as it invades in its place of origin, may also work its way into blood vessels. If cancer gets into the blood vessels, the blood vessels provide yet another route for the cancer to spread to other organs of the body. | No
13010 | NarrativeText | Breast cancer follows this classic progression though it often becomes systemic or widespread early in the course of the disease. By the time one can feel a lump in the breast it is often 0.4 inches, or one centimeter, in size and contains roughly a million cells. It is estimated that a tumor of this size may take one to five years to develop. During that time, the cancer may metastasize, or spread by lymphatics or blood to areas elsewhere in the body. | No
13011 | NarrativeText | When primary breast cancer spreads, it may first go to the regional lymph nodes under the armpit, the axil- lary nodes. If this occurs, regional metastasis exists. If it proceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic or blood-borne spread, the patient develops systemic metastasis that may involve a number of other organs in the body. Favorite sites of systemic involvement for breast cancer are the lung, bones, liver, and the skin and soft tissue. As it turns out, the presence of, and the actual number of, regional lymph nodes containing cancer remains the single best indicator of whether or not the cancer has become widely metastatic. Because tests to discover metastasis in other organs may not be sensitive enough to reveal minute deposits, the evaluation of the axilla for regional metasta- sis becomes very important in making treatment deci- sions for this disease. | No

13015 | NarrativeText | Every woman is at risk for breast cancer. If she lives to be 85, there is a one out of nine chance that she will develop the condition sometime during her life. As a woman ages, her risk of developing breast cancer rises dramatically regardless of her family history. The breast cancer risk of a 25-year-old woman is only one out of 19,608; by age 45, it is one in 93. In fact, less than 5% of cases are discovered before age 35 and the majority of all breast cancers are found in women over age 50. | No
13016 | NarrativeText | In 1999, there were 180,000 new cases of breast can- cer diagnosed. About 45,000 women die of breast cancer each year, accounting for 16% of deaths caused by cancer in women. For the first time ever, mortality rates decreased an average of 1.7% per year from 1995 through 1999, a reflection of earlier diagnosis and improving therapies. | No
13017 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13018 | NarrativeText | There are a number of risk factors for the develop- ment of breast cancer, including: ¢ family history of breast cancer in mother or sister + early onset of menstruation and late menopause | No
13019 | ListItem | * reproductive history: women who had no children or have children after age 30 and women who have never breastfed have increased risk « history of abnormal breast biopsies | No
13020 | NarrativeText | Though these are recognized risk factors, it is impor- tant to note that more than 70% of women who get breast cancer have no known risk factors. Having several risk factors may boost a woman’s chances of developing breast cancer, but the interplay of predisposing factors is complex. In addition to those accepted factors listed above, some studies suggest that high-fat diets, obesity, or the use of alcohol may contribute to the risk profile. Another factor that may contribute to a woman’s risk profile is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). | No
13021 | NarrativeText | HRT provides significant relief of menopausal symptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and possibly pro- tection from cardiovascular disease and stroke. Howev- er, studies show that there is a small increased risk of developing breast cancer with HRT use. Thus, the use of hormone replacement therapy should be based on per- sonal risk factors. | No
13022 | NarrativeText | Of all the risk factors listed above, family history is the most important. In The Biological Basis of Cancer, the authors estimate that probably about half of all famil- ial breast cancer cases (families in which there is a high breast cancer frequency) have mutations affecting the tumor suppressor gene BRCA-1. Another gene (BRCA- 2) also appears to confer inherited vulnerability to early- onset breast cancers. However, breast cancer due to heredity is only a small proportion of breast cancer cases; only 5%-10% of all breast cancer cases will be women who inherited a susceptibility through their genes. Nev- ertheless, when the family history is strong for develop- ment of breast cancer, a woman’s risk is increased. | No
13023 | NarrativeText | Not all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous. Fibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely common. Also known as fibrocystic condition of the breast, fibro- cystic changes are a leading cause of non-cancerous lumps in the breast. Fibrocystic changes also cause symptoms of pain, swelling, or discharge and may become evident to the patient or physician as a lump that is either solid or filled with fluid. Complete diagnostic evaluation of any significant breast abnormality is mandatory because though women commonly develop fibrocystic changes, breast cancer is common also, and the signs and symptoms of fibrocystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer. | No
13024 | Title | Diagnosis | No
13025 | NarrativeText | The diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished by the biopsy of any suspicious lump or mammographic abnor- mality that has been identified. (A biopsy is the removal of tissue for examination by a pathologist. A mammogram is a low-dose, 2-view, x-ray examination of the breast.) The patient may be prompted to visit her doctor upon finding a lump in a breast, or she may have noticed skin dimpling, nipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple. Or, the patient may not have noticed anything abnormal, and a lump is detected by the mammogram. | No
13026 | Title | When a patient has no signs or symptoms | No
13027 | NarrativeText | Screening involves the evaluation of women who have no symptoms or signs of a breast problem, so when the screening mammogram leads to the evaluation, the patient has no symptoms and may not have any abnor- mality on examination of the breast. Mammography has been very helpful in detecting breast cancer that one can- not identify on physical examination. However, 10%-13% of breast cancer does not show up on mam- mography, and a similar number of patients with breast cancer have an abnormal mammogram and a normal physical examination. These figures emphasize the need for examination as part of the screening process. | No
13028 | Title | Screening | No
13029 | NarrativeText | It is recommended that women get into the habit of doing monthly breast self examinations to detect any Mammogram indicating a tumor in the center of the breast. (Chris Bjornberg, Photo Researchers. Reproduced by permission.) | No
13030 | NarrativeText | lump at an early stage. If an uncertainty or a lump is found, evaluation by an experienced physician and mam- mography is recommended. The American Cancer Soci- ety (ACS) has made recommendations for the use of mammography on a screening basis. There has been con- troversy about the timing and appropriate frequency of mammography when used as a screening tool, but the ACS recommendations are as follows: Women should get annual mammograms after age 40. Those with a sig- nificant family history (one or more first-degree relatives who have been treated for breast cancer), should start annual mammograms 10 years younger than the youngest relative was when she was diagnosed, but not earlier than 35. | No
13031 | NarrativeText | Because of the greater awareness of breast cancer in recent years, screening evaluations by examinations and mammography are performed much more frequently than in the past. The result is that the number of breast cancers diagnosed increased, but the disease is being diagnosed at an earlier stage than previously. The earlier the stage of | No

13034 | Title | When a patient has physical signs or symptoms | No
13035 | NarrativeText | A very common finding that leads to diagnosis is the presence of a lump within the breast. Skin dimpling, nip- ple retraction, or discharge from the nipple are less fre- quent initial findings prompting biopsy. Though bloody nipple discharge is distressing, it is most often caused by benign disease. Skin dimpling or nipple retraction in the presence of an underlying breast mass on examination is a more advanced finding. Actual skin involvement, with edema or ulceration of the skin, are late findings. | No
13036 | NarrativeText | A very common presenting sign is the presence of a breast lump. If the lump is suspicious and the patient has not had a mammogram by this point, a study should be done on both breasts prior to anything else so that the original characteristics of the lesion can be studied. The opposite breast should also be evaluated mammographi- cally to determine if other problems exist that were unde- tected by physical examination. | No
13037 | NarrativeText | Whether an abnormal screening mammogram or one of the signs mentioned above followed by a mammogram prompted suspicion, the diagnosis is established by obtaining tissue by biopsy of the area. There are different types of biopsy, each utilized with its own indication depending on the presentation of the patient. If signs of widespread metastasis are already present, biopsy of the metastasis itself may establish diagnosis. | No
13039 | NarrativeText | Depending on the situation, different types of biopsy may be performed. The types include incisional and exci- sional biopsies. In an incisional biopsy, the physician takes a sample of tissue, and in excisional biopsy, the mass is removed. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and core needle biopsy are kinds of incisional biopsies. | No
13040 | NarrativeText | FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY. In a fine needle aspiration biopsy, a fine-gauge needle may be passed into the lesion and cells from the area suctioned into the nee- dle can be quickly prepared for microscopic evaluation (cytology). (The patient experiencing nipple discharge can have a sample taken of the discharge for cytological evaluation, also.) Fine needle aspiration is a simple pro- cedure that can be done under local anesthesia, and will tell if the lesion is a fluid-filled cyst or whether it is solid. The sample obtained will yield much diagnostic informa- tion. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent tech- nique when the lump is palpable and the physician can easily hit the target with the needle. If the lesion is a sim- ple cyst, the fluid will be evacuated and the mass will | No
13041 | Title | 580 | No
13042 | NarrativeText | disappear. If it is solid, the diagnosis may be obtained. Care must be taken, however, because if the mass is solid and the specimen is non-malignant, a complete removal of the lesion may be appropriate to be sure. | No
13043 | NarrativeText | CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY. Core needle biopsies are also obtained simply under local anesthesia. The larger piece of tissue obtained with its preserved architecture may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis short of open surgical removal. An open surgical incisional biopsy is rarely needed for diagnosis because of the needle techniques. If there remains question as to diagnosis, a complete open surgical biopsy may be required. | No
13044 | NarrativeText | EXCISIONAL BIOPSY. When performed, the excision- al, (complete removal) biopsy is a minimal outpatient procedure often done under local anesthesia. | No
13045 | NarrativeText | NON-PALPABLE LESIONS. As screening increases, non-palpable lesions demonstrated only by mammogra- phy are becoming more common. The use of x rays and computers to guide the needle for biopsy or to place markers for the surgeon performing the excisional biopsy are commonly employed. Some benign lesions can be fully removed by multiple directed core biopsies. These techniques are very appealing because they are minimal- ly invasive; however, the physician needs to be careful to obtain a good sample. | No
13046 | Title | Other tests | No
13047 | NarrativeText | If a lesion is not palpable and has simple cystic char- acteristics on mammography, ultrasound may be utilized both to determine that it is a cyst and to guide its evacua- tion. Ultrasound may also be used in some cases to guide fine needle or core biopsies of the breast. | No
13048 | NarrativeText | Computed tomography (CT scan, CAT scans), and magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), have only a very occasional use in the evaluation of breast lesions. | No
13049 | Title | Treatment | No
13050 | Title | Staging | No
13051 | NarrativeText | Once diagnosis is established, before treatment is rendered, more tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast. These tests include a chest x ray and blood count with liver function tests. Along with the liver function measured by the blood sample, the level of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme from bone, is also determined. A radionuclear bone scan may be ordered. This test looks at the places in the body to which breast cancer usually metastasizes. A CT scan may also be ordered. The physician will do a careful examination of the axilla to assess likelihood of regional metastasis but unfortunately this exam is not very accurate. Since the axillary node status is the best reflection of possible widespread disease, these nodes in part or all will be removed at the time of surgical treatment. | No
13052 | NarrativeText | Using the results of these studies, clinical stage is defined for the patient. This helps define treatment proto- col and prognosis. After surgical treatment, the final, or pathologic, stage is defined as the true axillary lymph node status is known. Detailed staging criteria are avail- able from the American Joint Commission on Cancer Manual and are generalized here: « Stage 1—The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in) and no cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes. | No
13053 | ListItem | « Stage 2—The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm, and the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. | No
13054 | ListItem | « Stage 3A—Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is small- er than 5 cm, but has spread to the lymph nodes, which have grown into each other. | No
13055 | ListItem | « Stage 3B—Cancer has spread to tissues near the breast, (local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside the chest wall, along the breastbone. | No
13056 | ListItem | « Stage 4—Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes beyond the axilla or to other organs of the body. | No
13057 | Title | Treatment | No
13058 | NarrativeText | Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are all uti- lized in the treatment of breast cancer. Depending on the stage, they will be used in different combinations or sequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the type and stage of the disease being treated. | No
13059 | NarrativeText | SURGERY. Historically, surgical removal of the entire breast and axillary contents along with the muscles down to the chest wall was performed as the lone thera- py, (radical mastectomy). In the last twenty-five years, as it has been appreciated that breast cancer is often sys- temic early in its course, the role of surgery is still prima- ry but of less and less magnitude. | No
13060 | NarrativeText | Today, surgical treatment is best thought of as a combination of removal of the primary tumor and stag- ing of the axillary lymph nodes. If the whole breast is removed along with the entire axillary contents, but the muscles of the chest wall are not, the modified radical mastectomy has been performed. | No
13061 | NarrativeText | If the tumor is less than 1.5 in (4 cm) in size and located so that it can be removed without destroying a reasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual breast, just the primary tumor and a rim of normal tissue will be removed. The axillary nodes will still be removed for staging purposes, usually through a separate incision. Because of the risk of recurrence in the remaining breast tissue, radiation is used to lessen the chance of local This illustration shows the frequency of breast cancer developing in the four quadrants of the breast and the nip- ple.

13062 | NarrativeText | recurrence. This type of primary therapy is known as lumpectomy, (or segmental mastectomy), and axillary dissection. | No
13063 | NarrativeText | Currently the necessary extent of the axillary dissec- tion is being questioned. Sentinel lymph node biopsy, a technique for identifying which nodes in the axilla drain the tumor, has been developed to provide selective sam- pling and further lessen the degree of surgical trauma the patient experiences. | No
13064 | NarrativeText | When patients are selected appropriately based on the preoperative clinical stage, all of these surgical approaches have been shown to produce similar results. In planning primary surgical therapy, it is imperative that the operation is tailored to fit the clinical circumstance of the patient. | No
13065 | NarrativeText | The pathologic stage is determined after surgical treatment absolutely defines the local parameters. In addition to stage, there are other tests that are very neces- sary to aid in decisions regarding treatment. Handling of the surgical specimen is thus very important. The tissue needs to be analyzed for the presence or absence of hor- mone receptors and a receptor called HER-2. The pres- ence of these receptors will influence additional thera- pies. Microscopic evaluation may also include the assessment of lymphatic or blood vessel invasion as these predict a worse outcome. The DNA of the tumor cells is quantitatively analyzed to help decide the biolog- ic aggressiveness of the tumor. These parameters will be utilized collectively along with the axillary lymph node status to define the anticipated aggressiveness of the can- cer. This assessment, along with the age and general con- dition of the patient, will be considered when planning the adjuvant therapies. Adjuvant therapies are treatments utilized after the primary treatment to help ensure that no microscopic disease exists and to help prolong patients’ survival time. | No
13066 | NarrativeText | RADIATION. surgical therapy, radiation thera- py is a local modality—it treats the tissue exposed to it and not the rest of the body. Radiation is usually given post-operatively after surgical wounds have healed. The pathologic stage of the primary tumor is now known and this aids in treatment planning. The extent of the local surgery also influences the planning. Radiation may not be needed at all after modified radical mastectomy for stage I disease, but is almost always utilized when breast- preserving surgery is performed. If the tumor was exten- sive or if multiple nodes were involved, the field of tissue exposed will vary accordingly. Radiation is utilized as an adjunct to surgical therapy and is considered an important modality in gaining local control of the tumor. The use of radiation therapy does not affect decisions for adjuvant treatment. In the past, radiation was used as an alternative to surgery on occasion. However, now that breast-pre- serving surgical protocols have been developed, primary radiation treatment of the tumor is no longer performed. Radiation also has an important role in the treatment of the patient with disseminated disease, particularly if it involves the skeleton. Radiation therapy can effect pain control and prevention of fracture in this circumstance. | No
13067 | NarrativeText | DRUG THERAPY. Many breast cancers, particularly those originating in post-menopausal women, are responsive to hormones. These cancers have receptors on their cells for estrogen and progesterone. Part of primary tumor assessment after removal of the tumor is the evalu- ation for the presence of these estrogen and progesterone receptors. If they are present on the cancer cells, altering the hormone status of the patient will inhibit tumor growth and have a positive impact on survival. The drug tamoxifen binds up these receptors on the cancer cells so that the hormones can’t have an effect and, in so doing, inhibits tumor growth. If the patient has these receptors present, tamoxifen is commonly prescribed for five years as an adjunct to primary treatment. Adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen has few side effects but they have to be kept in mind, particularly the need for yearly evalu- ation of the uterus. Other agents directed at altering hor- mone environment are under study. Because of these agents, there is rarely any need for surgical removal of hormone-producing glands, such as the ovary or adrenal, that was sometimes necessary in the past. | No
13068 | NarrativeText | Shortly after the modified radical mastectomy replaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgical treatment, it was appreciated that survival after local treatment in stage II breast cancer was improved by the addition of chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for an interval of four to six months is now standard treatment for patients with stage II disease. The addition of sys- temic therapy to local treatment in patients who have no evidence of disease is performed on the basis that some patients have metastasis that are not currently demonstra- ble because they are microscopic. By treating the whole patient early, before widespread disease is diagnosed, the adjuvant treatment improves survival rates from roughly 60% for stage II to about 75% at five years after treat- ment. The standard regimen of cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-flourouracil, (CMF), is given for six months and is well tolerated. The regimen of cytoxan, adriamycin (dox- orubicin), and 5-floururacil, (CAF), is a bit more toxic but only requires four months. (Adriamycin and cytoxin may also be used alone, without the fluorouracil.) The two methods are about equivalent in results. Adjuvant hormonal therapy may be added to the adjuvant chemo- therapy as they work through different routes. | No
13069 | NarrativeText | As one would expect, the encouraging results from adjuvant therapy in stage II disease have led to the study of similar therapy in stage I disease. The results are not as dramatic, but they are real. Currently, stage I disease is divided into categories a, b, and c on the basis of tumor size. Stage Ia is less than a centimeter in diameter. Adju- vant hormonal or chemotherapy is now commonly rec- ommended for stage Ib and Ic patients. The toxicity of the treatment must be weighed individually for the patient as patients with stage I disease have a survivor- ship of over 80% without adjuvant chemotherapy. | No
13070 | NarrativeText | If patients are diagnosed with stage IV disease or, in spite of treatment, progress to a state of widespread dis- ease, systemic chemotherapy is utilized in a more aggressive fashion. In addition to the adriamycin-con- taining regimens, the taxols (docetaxel and paclitaxel) have been found to be effective in inducing remission. | No
13071 | NarrativeText | On the basis of prognostic factors such as total num- ber of involved nodes over 10, aneuploid DNA with a high synthesis value, or aggressive findings on micro- scopic evaluation, some patients with stage II or III dis- ease can be predicted to do poorly. If their performance status allows, they can be considered for treatment with highly aggressive chemotherapy. The toxicity is such that bone marrow failure will result.

Most patients who receive this therapy receive it as part of a clinical trial. At present, it is unclear that such aggressive therapy can be justified and it is under study. | No
13085 | NarrativeText | For patients who are diagnosed with advanced local disease, surgery may be preceded with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The disease locally regresses allowing traditional surgical treatment to those who could not receive it otherwise. Chemotherapy and some- times radiation therapy will continue after the surgery. The regimens of this type are referred to as neo-adjuvant therapy. This has been proven to be effective in stage III disease. Neo-adjuvant therapy is now being studied in patients with large tumors that are stage II in an effort to be able to offer breast preservation to these patients. | No

The product of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 gene, (HER-2) is overex- pressed in 25%-30% of breast cancers. Herceptin binds to the HER-2 receptors on the cancer, resulting in the arrest of growth of these cells. | No
13087 | Title | Prognosis | No
13088 | NarrativeText | The prognosis for breast cancer depends on the type and stage of cancer. Over 80% of stage I patients are cured by current therapies. Stage II patients survive over- all about 70% of the time, those with more extensive lymph nodal involvement doing worse than those with disease confined to the breast. About 40% of stage III patients survive five years, and about 20% of stage IV patients do so. | No
13089 | Title | Coping with cancer treatment | No
13090 | NarrativeText | Surgery for breast cancer is physically well-tolerated by the patient, especially those undergoing minimal surgery in the axilla. Most patients can return to a normal lifestyle within a month or so after surgery. Exercises can help the patient regain strength and flexibility. Arm, shoulder, and chest exercises help, and complete recov- ery of activity is to be expected. | No
13091 | NarrativeText | About 5-7% of patients undergoing complete axil- lary lymph node resection as part of their therapy may develop clinically significant lymphedema, or swelling in the arm on the side of involvement. If present, eleva- tion and massage may be needed intermittently. Though usually not serious, on occasion this complication may interfere with complete physical recovery. The incidence of lymphedema is less with less axillary surgery. This is the reason for the enthusiasm for sentinel node biopsy as the surgical staging procedure in the axilla. | No
13092 | NarrativeText | It is common after breast cancer treatment to be depressed or moody, to cry, lose appetite, or feel unwor- thy or less interested in sex. The breast is involved with a woman’s identity and loss of it may be disturbing. For some, counseling or a support group can help. Many women have found a support group of breast cancer sur- vivors to be an invaluable help during this stage. Involve- ment with volunteers from the local chapter of the Reach to Recovery program may be very helpful. | No
13093 | NarrativeText | Nearly all patients undergo some form of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. The magnitude of the toxicity of these adjuvant therapies is usually small and many patients receiving chemotherapy on this basis are capable of normal activity during this time. Certainly, those who progress to advanced disease are treated with more toxic chemothera- peutic regimens in an attempt to induce remission. | No

The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) with support from the National Cancer Insti- tute began a study in 1992 (called the Breast Cancer Pre- vention Trial, or BCPT) studying the use of tamoxifen as a breast cancer preventative for high-risk women. The results yielded from the study showed that tamoxifen sig- nificantly reduced breast cancer risk, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of tamoxifen to reduce breast cancer risk for high-risk patients in 1998. Another NSABP study, known as STAR, is seek- ing to understand if another drug, raloxifene, is as effec- tive as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk in high- risk patients. That study was begun in 1999, and partici- pants are to be monitored for five years. | No

13104 | NarrativeText | Though breast-preserving therapy is being done more frequently than in years past, modified radical mastectomy remains an option when selecting therapy for the primary tumor. This option may allow treatment without radiation in earlier stage patients, or may be necessary if the presen- tation of the tumor does not allow breast preservation. Loss of the breast is disfiguring and many patients so treated desire reconstruction of the breast. Breast reconstruction is performed either at the time of initial surgery (immedi- ate) or it may be delayed. Alternatives include placement of implants or the rotation of muscle flaps from the abdomen or back. Most agree that breast preservation gives superior results to any form of reconstruction. When the breast is removed as part of primary therapy, these reconstructions are available and do produce very reasonable results. | No

13137 | NarrativeText | Breast implantation is usually performed to make normal breasts larger for cosmetic purposes.

13141 | Title | Description | No
13142 | NarrativeText | A cosmetic breast enlargement is usually an outpa- tient procedure. It may be done under local or general anesthesia, depending on patient and physician prefer- ence. The incision is made through the armpit, under the breast, or around the areola (the darkened area around the nipple). These techniques create the most inconspicu- ous scars. The implant is placed between the breast tissue and underlying chest muscle, or under the chest muscle. The operation takes approximately one to two hours. The cost of a cosmetic procedure is rarely covered by insur- ance. However, if enlargement is part of breast recon- struction after a mastectomy, health plans may pay for some or all of it. The surgeon’s fee ranges from $2,700- $4,200 and up. The procedure may also be called breast augmentation or augmentation mammaplasty. | No
13143 | Title | Preparation | No
13144 | NarrativeText | Before the surgery is performed, the woman should have a clear understanding of what her new breasts will look like. She and her physician should agree about the desired final result. Many surgeons find it helpful to have the patient review before and after pictures, to clarify expectations. | No
13145 | Title | Aftercare | No
13146 | NarrativeText | Driving and normal activities may be restricted for up to one week. Stitches are usually removed in seven to 10 days. Typically, a woman can resume all routines, including vigorous exercise, in about three weeks. The scars will be red for approximately one month, but will fade to their final appearance within one or two years. | No
13147 | Title | Risks | No
13148 | NarrativeText | Risks which are common to any surgical procedure include bleeding, infection, anesthesia reaction, or unex- pected scarring. A breast enlargement may also result in decreased sensation in the breast, or interference with breast-feeding. Implants can also make it more difficult to read and interpret mammograms, possibly delaying breast cancer detection. Also, the implant itself can rup- ture and leak, or become displaced. A thick scar that nor- mally forms around the implant, called a capsule, can become very hard. This is called capsular contracture, and may result in pain and/or an altered appearance of the breast. The older the implant, the greater the chances that these problems will occur. | No
13149 | NarrativeText | There has been intermittent publicity about possible health risks from breast implants. Most concerns have focused on silicone gel-filled implants. As of 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the use of this type of implant, and ordered further studies. Today only saline-filled implants are used for cosmetic breast surgery. Recent studies have shown no evidence long- term health risks from silicone implants. However, research on the possible links between these implants and autoimmune or connective tissue diseases is continuing. | No

13163 | NarrativeText | Breast reconstruction is a series of surgical proce- dures performed to recreate a breast. Reconstructions are commonly done after one or both breasts are removed as a treatment for breast cancer. Also, a breast may need to be refashioned for other reasons, such as trauma or abnormalities that occur during breast development. | No
13164 | Title | Purpose | No
13165 | NarrativeText | Many authorities consider reconstruction an integral part of the therapy for breast cancer. A breast that appears natural offers a sense of wholeness and normal- cy, which can aid in the psychological recovery from breast cancer. It eliminates the need for an external pros- thesis (false breast), which many women find physically uncomfortable as well as inconvenient. | No
13166 | Title | Precautions | No
13167 | NarrativeText | Not all women are good candidates for breast recon- struction. Overall poor physical health, or specific prob- lems such as cigarette smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, or diabetes, will increase the chance of compli- cations. Also, a difficult and/or prolonged recovery peri- od or failure of the reconstruction may be a result. A woman’s physical ability to cope with major surgery and recuperation also need to be considered. | No
13168 | Title | Description | No
13169 | NarrativeText | Breast reconstruction is done in two stages, with the ultimate goal of creating a breast which looks and feels as natural as possible. It is important to remember that while a good result may mimic a normal breast closely, there will inevitably be scars and loss of sensation. The reconstructed breast cannot be exactly like the original. | No
13170 | NarrativeText | The first step is to form a structure called a breast mound. This can be accomplished using artificial materials called breast implants, or by using tissues from other parts of the woman’s body. The second step involves creating a balance between the newly constructed breast and the breast on the opposite side. The nipple and areolar complex (darker area around the nipple) are recreated. This is usual- ly done several months after the mound is created, to allow swelling to go down. Other procedures may be necessary, such as lifting the opposite breast (mastopexy), or making it larger or smaller to match the reconstructed breast. | No
13171 | Title | Timing, immediate or delayed reconstruction | No
13172 | NarrativeText | While immediate reconstruction (IR) is not recom- mended for women with breast cancer who need to under- go other, more important treatments, breast reconstruction can be done almost anytime. It even can be done during the same procedure as the mastectomy, or it can be delayed. There are psychological benefits to IR. The ability to return to normal activities and routines is often enhanced when reconstruction follows immediately after mastectomy. A better appearance may result from IR. There is less skin removal, often resulting in a shorter scar. The surgeon is better able to preserve the normal boundaries of the breast, So it is easier to match the opposite breast more closely. | No
13173 | NarrativeText | The cost of IR is generally lower than the cost of delayed reconstruction (DR). There is one fewer opera- tion and hospital stay. Surgeon’s fees may be lower for a combined procedure than for two separate surgeries. | No
13174 | NarrativeText | There are disadvantages of IR as well. The surgery itself is longer, causing more time under anesthesia. Post-operative pain and recovery time will be greater than for mastectomy alone. | No
13175 | NarrativeText | Other authorities contend that delayed reconstruc- tion (DR) offers different physical and psychological advantages. The initial mastectomy procedure alone takes less time, and has a shorter recovery period and less pain than mastectomy and IR. The patient has more time to adjust to her diagnosis and recover from additional therapy. She is better able to research her options, and to formulate realistic goals for reconstruction. Some recon- structive surgery requires blood transfusions. With DR, the patient can donate her own blood ahead of time (autologous transfusion), and/or arrange to have family and friends donate blood for her use (directed donation). | No
13176 | NarrativeText | The psychological stress of living without a breast is a disadvantage of DR. The extra procedure DR entails results in higher costs. Although initial recovery is faster, | No
13177 | NarrativeText | an additional recuperation period is required after the delayed operation. | No
13178 | Title | Type of reconstruction | No
13179 | NarrativeText | There are two basic choices for breast reconstruc- tion. The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant or the breast is created using some of the woman’s own tis- sues (autologous reconstruction). | No
13180 | NarrativeText | ARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS. In general, implant proce- dures take less time, and are less expensive than autolo- gous ones. Implants are breast shaped pouches. They are made of silicone outer shells, which may be smooth or textured. The inside may contain silicone gel, saline (salt water), or a combination of both. | No
13181 | NarrativeText | An implant may be a fixed volume type, which can- not change its size. Implants that have the capacity to be filled after insertion are called tissue expanders. These may be temporary or permanent. | No
13182 | NarrativeText | The initial procedure for any implant insertion uses the mastectomy incision to make a pocket of tissue, usu- ally underneath the chest wall muscle. In DR, the mas- tectomy scar may be re opened and used for this purpose, or a more cosmetic incision may be made. The implant is inserted into the pocket, the skin is stretched as needed and stitched closed. | No
13183 | NarrativeText | If there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired size, or a naturally sagging breast is desired, a tissue expander is used. It resembles a partially deflated balloon, with an attached valve or port through which saline can be injected. After the initial surgical incision is healed, the woman returns to the doctor’s office, on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, to have small amounts of saline injected. Injections can continue for about six to eight weeks, until the preferred size is obtained. In some cases it may be overfilled, and later partially deflated to allow for a more pliable, natural result. A temporary tissue expander will be removed after several months and replaced with a permanent implant. | No
13184 | NarrativeText | IR surgery using an implant takes approximately two to three hours, and usually requires up to a three day hospital stay. Implant insertion surgery, as part of DR, takes one to two hours and can sometimes be done as an outpatient, or it or it may entail overnight hospitalization. | No
13185 | NarrativeText | AUTOLOGUS RECONSTRUCTION. Attached flap and free flap are two types of surgery where a woman’s tissue is used in reconstruction. An attached flap uses skin, mus- cle, and fat, leaving blood vessels attached to their origi- nal source of blood. The flap is maneuvered to the recon- struction site, keeping its original blood supply for nour- ishment. This may also be known as a pedicle flap. The second kind of surgery is called a free flap. This also uses skin, muscle, and fat, but severs the blood vessels, and | No

Autologous reconstruction, in which a woman’s own tissues are used, includes the latissimus dorsi flap, where skin and muscle taken from the back is rotated around to the breast area, and the TRAM flap, in which abdominal fat and muscle are tunneled under the skin to the breast area.

Some- times the term microsurgery is used to refer to free flap procedures. Either type of surgery may also be called a myocutaneous flap, referring to the skin and muscle used. | No
13189 | NarrativeText | The skin and muscle used in autologous reconstruc- tion can come from one of several possible places on the body, including the abdomen (TRAM flap or “tummy tuck’), the back (latissimus dorsi flap), or the buttocks (gluteus maximus free flap). | No
13190 | NarrativeText | opposite breast larger (augmentation), smaller (reduction), or higher (mastopexy). These, or any other refinements should be completed before the creation of a nipple and areola. Tissue to form the new nipple may come from the reconstructed breast itself, the opposite breast, or a more distant donor site, such as the inner thigh or behind the ear. The nipple and areolar construction is usually an outpatient procedure. A final step, often done in the doctor’s office, is tattooing the new nipple and areola, to match the color of the opposite nipple and areola as closely as possible. | No

13196 | NarrativeText | Implants may pose additional insurance concerns. Some companies will withdraw coverage for women with implants, or add a disclaimer for future implant- related problems. Careful reading of insurance policies, including checking on the need for pre-approval and/or a second opinion, is strongly recommended. | No
13197 | Title | Preparation | No
13198 | NarrativeText | Routine preoperative preparations, such as taking nothing to eat or drink the night before surgery are need- ed for reconstructive procedures. Blood transfusions are often necessary for autologous reconstructive surgeries. The patient may donate her own blood, and/or have fami- ly and friends donate several weeks before the surgery. | No
13199 | NarrativeText | Emotional preparation is also important. Breast reconstruction will not resolve a psychological problem the woman had before mastectomy, nor make an unstable relationship strong. An expectation of physical perfection is unrealistic. A woman who cites any of these reasons for reconstruction shows that she has not been adequate- ly informed or prepared. Complete understanding of the benefits and limitations of this surgery is necessary for a satisfactory result. | No
13200 | Title | Aftercare | No
13201 | NarrativeText | The length of the hospital stay, recovery period, and frequency of visits to the doctor after surgery varies consid- erably with the different kinds of reconstruction. In general, autologous procedures require longer hospitalization and recovery time than implant procedures. Bandages and drainage tubes remain in place for at least a day for all surg- eries. Microsurgical or free flaps are most closely moni- tored in the first day or two after surgery. The circulation to the breast may be checked as often as every hour. Complete breast reconstruction requires at least one additional surgery to create a nipple and areola. Scars may remain red and raised for a month or longer. The true, final appearance of the breasts will not be visible for at least one year. | No

In addition, patients must sign a consent form which details the potential risks of silicone gel-filled implants, and become enrolled in a long range study. Saline filled implants are permitted for all uses, although manufactur- ers must collect data on possible risks. | No
13212 | NarrativeText | The FDA issued a status report on Breast Implant Safety in 1995, and revised it in March 1997. It noted that studies so far have not shown a serious increase in the risk of recognized autoimmune diseases in women with silicone gel-filled breast implants. It also addressed concerns about other complications and emphasized the need for further study of this issue. | No
13213 | NarrativeText | There are a number of risks common to any surgical procedure such as bleeding, infection, anesthesia reac- tion, or unexpected scarring. Hematoma (accumulation of blood at the surgical site), or seroma (collection of fluid at the surgical site) can delay healing if not drained. Any breast reconstruction also poses a risk of asymmetry and/or the need for unplanned surgical revision. Persis- tent pain is another potential complication possible with all types of breast reconstruction. | No
13214 | NarrativeText | Implants have some unique problems that may develop. A thick scar, also called a capsule, forms around the implant, as part of the body’s normal reaction to a foreign substance. Capsular contracture occurs when the scar becomes firm or hardened. This may cause pain and/or change the texture and appearance of the breast. Implants can rupture and leak, deflate, or become dis- placed. The chances of capsular contracture or rupture increase with the age of the implant. These complica- tions can usually be remedied with outpatient surgery to loosen the capsule or remove and/or replace the implant as needed. There is some evidence that using implants with textured surfaces may decrease the incidence of these problems. An implant tends to remain firm indefi- nitely. It will not grow larger or smaller as the woman’s weight changes. Asymmetry can develop if a woman gains or loses a large amount of weight. | No
13215 | NarrativeText | The autologous procedures all carry a risk of flap failure—loss of blood supply to the tissue forming the new breast. If a large portion of the flap develops inade- quate blood supply, another reconstructive technique may be necessary. TRAM flap procedures can result in decreased muscle tone and weakness in the abdomen and/or abdominal hernia. Arm weakness may occur after latissimus dorsi flap surgery. | No
13216 | Title | Normal results | No
13217 | NarrativeText | A normal result of breast reconstruction depends on the woman’s goals and expectations. It will not be the same as the breast it replaces. In general, it should be sim- ilar in size and shape to the opposite breast, but will have less sensation and be less mobile than a natural breast. A reconstruction using implants will usually be firmer and rounder than the other breast. It may feel cooler to touch, depending on the amount of tissue over it. Scars are unavoidable, but should be as unobtrusive as possible. | No

13264 | Title | Purpose | No
13265 | NarrativeText | A BSE is one of three tests the American Cancer Society recommends to help detect breast cancer in its earliest stages. By regularly examining her own breasts, a woman is more likely to find any changes that may have occurred. The best time to perform a BSE is about a week after a woman’s period ends, when her breasts are not ten- der or swollen. If her periods are not regular, a BSE should be completed on the same day every month. A BSE should also be regularly completed by women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have breast implants. By combining a BSE with a mammography and clinical breast examination, a woman is offered the best opportu- nity for reducing chances of death from breast cancer through early detection. Close to 90% of breast cancers are found through a BSE. The American Cancer Society recommends that beginning at the age of 20, women com- plete a BSE each month by feeling for lumps or anything suspicious, as well as looking at their breasts carefully in a mirror for any changes in contour, swelling, dimpling, puckering of the skin, or changes in the nipple. | No

13293 | Title | Definition | No
13294 | NarrativeText | Breast ultrasound (or sonography) is an imaging technique for diagnosing breast disease, such as cancer. It uses harmless, high frequency sound waves to form an image (sonogram). The sound waves pass through the breast and bounce back or echo from various tissues to form a picture of the internal structures. It is not invasive and involves no radiation. | No
13295 | Title | Purpose | No
13296 | NarrativeText | Breast ultrasound may be used in several ways. The most common application is to investigate a specific area of the breast where a problem is suspected. A palpable lump and/or a lump or density discovered by x ray (mammogram) can be further evaluated by ultrasound. It is especially helpful in distinguishing between a fluid- filled cyst and a solid mass. It can also identify small lesions that are too tiny to be felt. | No
13297 | NarrativeText | Breast ultrasound is often the first study performed to evaluate masses in women under 35 whose mammograms can be difficult to interpret due to the density of their breast tissue. The lack of radiation used with ultrasound makes it ideal for studying breast abnormalities in women who are pregnant. Assessing breast implants for leakage or rupture is another way ultrasound is used. Breast inflammation, where pockets of infection or abscesses may form, can be diagnosed and monitored by ultrasound. | No
13298 | NarrativeText | Thickened and swollen breast skin may be a sign of inflammatory breast cancer. Ultrasound can sometimes identify a cancerous growth within the breast causing the thickened skin. These cases are usually followed by a core biopsy guided by ultrasound (described below). | No
13299 | NarrativeText | Breast ultrasound is employed to observe and guide a needle for several interventional procedures. These include cyst aspiration, fine needle aspiration, large core needle A breast ultrasound image. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.) | No
13300 | NarrativeText | biopsy (as a first step in determining treatment for a lesion that is likely to be cancerous), and needle localization in surgical breast biopsy. Biopsies guided by ultrasound have distinct advantages. The ultrasound guides the needle so that a lesion can be removed for the biopsy. Patients usually find that the procedure is less traumatic and more comfort- able than surgical biopsies. Ultrasound is known for its accuracy in determining how far a cancerous growth extends into the surrounding tissue in lesions that cannot be felt. Biopsies guided by ultrasound are generally less costly than surgical biopsies. Additionally, if the abnormality that requires biopsy can be seen on both a mammogram and ultrasound, an ultrasound-guided biopsy is often more comfortable for the patient as no compression is necessary. | No
13301 | Title | Description | No
13302 | NarrativeText | Ultrasound can be done in a doctor’s office or anoth- er outpatient setting, such as a hospital or imaging center. | No
13303 | NarrativeText | The patient removes her clothing from the waist up and puts on a hospital gown, open in the front. She lies on her back or side on an examining table. A gel that enhances sound transmission is spread over the area to be examined. The technologist then places a transducer, an instrument about the size of an electric shaver, against the skin. The images from reflected sound waves appear on a monitor screen. | No
13304 | NarrativeText | A good ultrasound study is difficult to obtain if the patient is unable to remain quietly in one position. Obe- sity may hinder clear viewing of internal structures, and the accuracy of an ultrasound study is highly dependent on the skill of the person performing the examination. The images recorded vary with the angle and pressure of the transducer and the equipment settings. The examina- tion may take from 30 to 45 minutes. Most insurance plans cover the cost of an ultrasound examination. | No

13307 | NarrativeText | Ductal carcinoma—A type of cancer that accounts for as much as 80% of breast cancers. These tumors feel bigger than they look on ultra- sound or mammogram. | No
13308 | NarrativeText | Fibroadenoma—A benign breast growth made up of fibrous tissue. It is the most common mass in women under 35 years of age, and is found in both breasts in 3% of cases. | No
13309 | NarrativeText | Infiltrating lobular carcinoma—A type of cancer that accounts for 8% to 10% of breast cancers. In breasts that are especially dense, ultrasound can be useful in identifying these masses. | No

13311 | NarrativeText | Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma—A type of cancer that accounts for 1% to 2% of breast cancers. Resembles medullary carcinoma in ultrasound and mammogram, but usually affects older women. | No
13312 | NarrativeText | Nonpalpable—Cannot be felt by hand. In cancer, growths that are nonpalpable are too small to be elt, but may be seen on ultrasound or mammo- gram. | No
13313 | NarrativeText | Papillary carcinoma—A type of breast cancer that primarily occurs in older women. On ultrasound, his type of tumor may look like a solid or com- plex mass, or it may show up as solid tissue pro- ruding into a cyst. | No
13314 | NarrativeText | Tubular carcinoma—A type of cancer that accounts or approximately 1% to 2% of breast cancers. Can appear small on ultrasound or mammogram. | No
13315 | Title | Normal results | No
13316 | NarrativeText | An ultrasound examination may reveal either normal tissue or a benign condition such as a cyst. Ultrasound can confidently diagnose a benign structure that has cer- tain characteristics of a simple cyst. In the case of a sim- ple cyst with no symptoms, additional treatment beyond continued observation is usually not needed. | No
13317 | Title | Abnormal results | No
13318 | NarrativeText | A potentially malignant mass can be identified by breast ultrasound. Abnormal results fall into the following categories: benign fibrous nodule, complex cyst, suspi- cious lesion, and lesion highly suggestive of cancer. In cases where ultrasound shows the presence of a complex cyst or fibrous nodule, a biopsy is justified because 10% to 15% of these growths are malignant. Lesions falling into the last two categories (suspicious or highly suggestive of cancer) have a higher chance of being cancerous, and should be investigated further, either by biopsy or surgery. | No
13319 | NarrativeText | Breast cancers such as the following may be identified on ultrasound: ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carci- noma, medullary carcinoma, mucinous (colloid) carcino- ma, tubular carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma. On ultra- sound, the shape of a lesion and the type of edges it has can sometimes indicate if it is benign or cancerous, but there are exceptions. For example, benign fibroadenomas are usually oval, and some cancers can be similarly shaped. Cancerous tumors usually have jagged edges, but some benign growths can have these edges as well. Ultrasound is not a definitive test. Tissue diagnosis is often required. | No

13333 | NarrativeText | Breech birth is the delivery of a fetus (unborn baby) hind end first. Between 3-4% of fetuses will start labor in the breech position, which is a potentially dangerous situation. | No
13334 | Title | 594 | No
13335 | Title | Description | No
13336 | NarrativeText | Throughout most of pregnancy, the developing fetus is completely free to move around within the uterus. Between 32-36 weeks, it becomes so large that movement is restricted. It is much harder for the fetus to turn over, so whatever position it has assumed by this point is likely to be the same position that he or she will be in when labor begins. | No
13337 | NarrativeText | For reasons that are not fully understood, almost all unborn babies settle into a head down position. The fetus is upside down in the uterus, and the head will lead the way during the birth process. | No
13338 | NarrativeText | Unfortunately, some fetuses do not cooperate. Most of these are in the breech position. The buttocks lead the way out of the uterus, and the legs are folded in front of the body (frank breech). Delivery from the breech posi- tion poses far more risks than delivery head first (vertex position). | No
13339 | NarrativeText | The biggest part of the fetus’s body is usually its head. If the head fits through the mother’s pelvis, then the rest of the fetus’s body should slip out fairly easily. If the fetus is born bottom first, it is possible that the body will fit through the mother’s pelvis, but the baby’s head will get stuck at the level of the chin. This condition, known as a trapped head, is very dangerous. | No
13340 | NarrativeText | When the baby’s head comes first, it has a chance to “mold” during labor. The bones of the baby’s skull are not yet fastened together the way they are in a child or adult’s skull, meaning that the bones of the baby’s skull can move. During the long hours of labor the skull can change shape to fit through the pelvis more easily, which is why many babies are born with a “cone head”. If the baby is born from the breech position, the skull does not have a chance to change shape to fit the pelvis, and it is even more likely to get stuck. | No
13341 | NarrativeText | If the baby’s head gets trapped, the possibility of injury is high. Once the baby’s body is born, the umbilical cord usually stops pulsating (just as it would during a nor- mal delivery). This cuts off the oxygen supply from the mother to the baby. If the baby’s head is still inside the uterus the baby cannot yet breathe on its own. Therefore, it is essential to deliver the baby as quickly as possible. | No
13342 | NarrativeText | The life saving attempts to deliver the baby’s head can cause injury to the baby’s neck or head resulting in permanent handicaps. In extreme cases, if the baby can- not be delivered within a few minutes, the baby might die. Obviously, it is critical to avoid a breech delivery with a trapped head. | No
13343 | NarrativeText | Of course, many babies are safely delivered from the breech position. There are certain factors that make a breech delivery more likely to be successful: if ultra- sound (a technique that uses sound waves to visualize the fetus) shows that the fetus is in the frank breech position, the fetus’s head is tucked on its chest, and the fetus is not big, it is less likely that its head will get stuck. | No
13344 | NarrativeText | Among breech babies born after the full nine-month term, smaller babies usually do better. This is not true for premature babies. Premature babies are more likely to have a trapped head because the body of a premature baby is usually much smaller than his or her head. Premature babies are generally not delivered from the breech position. | No
13345 | NarrativeText | The risks of vaginal breech delivery can be avoided by delivering the baby through a surgical procedure (cesarean section, also known as c-section). For the past twenty years, cesarean section has been recommended when the fetus is breech. More recently, many providers have offered the option of version, attempting to turn the fetus within the uterus to a head first position before labor begins. | No
13346 | NarrativeText | Version is based on a very simple idea. If a fetus in the breech position does a somersault, it will end up head down. During a version, the obstetrician tries to make the fetus do a somersault. | No
13347 | NarrativeText | A version should only be done in a hospital, with an ultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician in turning the fetus. The fetus should be monitored with a fetal monitor before and after the version. Some obstetri- cians give the mother an injection of medication to relax the mother’s uterus and prevent any contractions. | No
13348 | NarrativeText | During the procedure, the obstetrician places his or her hands on the mother’s abdomen to feel the location of the unborn baby’s buttocks and head. The buttocks are lifted up slightly and the doctor pushes on the baby’s head to encourage him to perform a somersault. It may take several tries before the fetus cooperates, but over half will eventually turn. | No
13349 | NarrativeText | A version is not appropriate for every fetus who is in the breech position at the end of pregnancy. It can only be tried if there is one fetus in the uterus, if the placenta is not lying in front of the fetus, and if the umbilical cord does not appear to be wrapped around the fetus at any point. | No
13350 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13351 | NarrativeText | The cause of breech birth is not known. There are generally no identifiable symptoms. However, some women can tell the position of the fetus by where they feel the fetus kicking. Most women cannot tell what position the fetus is in at any given moment. | No
13352 | Title | Diagnosis | No
13353 | NarrativeText | A health care provider can often tell the position of the fetus by feeling it through the wall of the mother’s Placenta Uterus Umbilical cord —— Breech Birth | No
13354 | NarrativeText | Approximately 3-4% of babies will start labor in the breech (buttocks first) position. While this is a potentially danger- ous situation, many full-term babies can be safely delivered from the breech position. (illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.) | No
13355 | NarrativeText | abdomen. Another clue to the position is the location where the heartbeat is heard best. If the fetus’s heartbeat is best heard below the level of the mother’s navel, it is likely to be positioned head first. On the other hand, if the heartbeat is best heard above the level of the navel, it is likely to be breech. | No
13356 | NarrativeText | The only way to really be sure, however, is to do an ultrasound exam. Using this technique it is very easy to tell the position of the fetus. | No
13357 | Title | Treatment | No
13358 | NarrativeText | If a fetus is in the breech position in the last weeks of pregnancy, there are three possible courses of action: Cesare- an section, attempted version, or vaginal breech delivery. | No
13359 | NarrativeText | Cesarean section is the most common way to deliver a breech baby. This surgical procedure carries more risk for the mother, but many women prefer to take the risk of surgery on themselves rather than let the baby face the risks of breech delivery. | No
13360 | NarrativeText | Version is gaining in popularity. Version is a medical procedure in which the obstetrician tries to turn the breech fetus to the head first position. Version is success- ful more than 50% of the time. However, some babies who are successfully turned will turn back to the breech position after the procedure is done. | No
13361 | Title | 595 | No
13362 | NarrativeText | Some women choose breech vaginal delivery. This should only be attempted if ultrasound shows that the fetus is in a favorable breech position. Most babies will do very well during a breech delivery, but it is always possible that the fetus will be injured, perhaps seriously. | No
13363 | Title | Prevention | No
13364 | NarrativeText | There is no way to prevent a fetus from settling into the breech position at the end of pregnancy. A woman who has had one breech fetus is more likely than average to have another. | No

13375 | Title | Description | No
13376 | NarrativeText | The bronchial tubes are the networks of branching tubes which deliver air to the tiny sacs of the lungs (alve- oli). In bronchiectasis, the diameter of the bronchi is unusually large. Examination of the walls of the bronchial tubes reveals destruction of the normal structural elements, with replacement by scar tissue. Pus collects within the bronchi, and the normal flow of oxygen into the lungs, and carbon dioxide out of the lungs (air exchange) is impaired. The bronchi show signs of inflammation, with swelling and invasion by a variety of immune cells. The inflamed areas show signs of increased growth of blood vessels. The area of the lung which should be served by a diseased bronchial tube is also prone to inflammation and infection. | No
13377 | Title | 596 | No
13378 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13379 | NarrativeText | Prior to the widespread use of immunizations, bronchiectasis was often the result of a serious infection with either measles or whooping cough. Currently, viruses that cause influenza (flu) or influenza-like syn- dromes, as well as a number of bacteria may precede the development of bronchiectasis. Patients who have been infected with tuberculosis or the virus which causes AIDS (HIV or human immunodeficiency virus) also have an increased chance of bronchiectasis. | No
13380 | NarrativeText | A number of pre-existing conditions may cause an individual to be more susceptible than normal to infec- tion, with increased risk of bronchiectasis developing. These conditions include disorders of cilia, and immune disorders. | No
13381 | NarrativeText | Cilia are the tiny hairs which usually line the bronchial tubes. Cilia wave constantly, sweeping the bronchial tubes clean of bacterial or viral invaders, and cleaning away excess secretions (mucus, sputum) which may be produced by the bronchi. When these cilia are abnormal or absent at birth, various bacterial or viral invaders may remain in the respiratory tract, multiply, and cause serious infections. | No
13382 | NarrativeText | Immune disorders include decreased production of certain immune chemicals (immunoglobulins) which usually serve to fight off infection by bacterial or viral invasion. When these immunoglobulins are not produced in large enough quantity, bacterial and viral invaders are not effectively killed off, and infection occurs. | No
13383 | NarrativeText | Other causes of bronchiectasis include an abnormal- ly blocked (obstructed) airway. This can be due to tumor growth within the bronchial tube, or due to a child acci- dentally inhaling a small object which then blocks off the bronchial tube. People with the disease called cystic fibrosis (CF) often have their bronchial tubes obstructed by the thick, sticky mucus which is a hallmark of CF. Toxic exposures (breathing ammonia, for example) can harm the bronchi, and lead to bronchiectasis. An extreme allergic response of the immune system to the presence of certain fungi (especially one called Aspergillus) can also damage the bronchial tubes enough to result in bronchiectasis. | No
13384 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of bronchiectasis include constant cough and the production of infected sputum (sputum is a mix- ture of mucus and pus), which may be bloody. In some cases, there may be wheezing and shortness of breath. The constant, low-level of infection may flare, resulting in increased production of sputum, worsening of the cough, and fever. The area of the lung served by the affected bronchial tube may become severely infected, resulting in pneumonia. | No

13386 | Title | Diagnosis | No
13387 | NarrativeText | Chest x ray may reveal evidence of bronchiectasis, and CT scans are particularly good at revealing the thick, dilated bronchial walls of bronchiectasis. Sputum will need to be collected and cultured (grown in a laboratory dish), in order to examine it microscopically for the spe- cific type of organism responsible for infection. A careful search for other underlying diseases is important, look- ing in particular for ciliary abnormalities, cystic fibrosis, or immunoglobulin deficiencies. | No
13388 | Title | Treatment | No
13389 | NarrativeText | Treatment should involve efforts to resolve any underlying disorder. Infections will require antibiotics, obstruction may require the removal of a foreign object or tumor. Medications are available to help thin the sputum, so that it can be more effectively coughed up. Rhythmic clapping on the chest and back, while the patient assumes a number of positions (head down, primarily), may help the lungs to drain more effectively. This is called chest physical therapy, or percussion and postural drainage. | No
13390 | NarrativeText | When a particular area of the lung is constantly and severely infected, surgery may be needed to remove it. When bleeding occurs from irritated bronchial tubes and over- grown bronchial blood vessels, surgery may be required either to remove an area of the bronchial tube, or to inject the bleeding blood vessel with a material to stop the bleeding. | No
13391 | NarrativeText | In some patients, bronchiectasis eventually leads to a constantly low level of blood oxygen, despite other treat- ments. These patients usually have an associated increase in the size of the right side of their hearts, along with a decrease in the heart’s ability to pump blood through the lungs. Some patients with extremely severe symptoms and disability have been treated with lung transplantation. | No

13411 | NarrativeText | Bronchitis is an inflammation of the air passages between the nose and the lungs, including the windpipe or trachea and the larger air tubes of the lung that bring air in from the trachea (bronchi). Bronchitis can either be of brief duration (acute) or have a long course (chronic). Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection, but can also be caused by a bacterial infection and can heal without complications. Chronic bronchitis is a sign of seri- ous lung disease that may be slowed but cannot be cured. | No
13412 | Title | Description | No
13413 | NarrativeText | Although acute and chronic bronchitis are both inflammations of the air passages, their causes and treat- ments are different. Acute bronchitis is most prevalent in winter. It usually follows a viral infection, such as a cold or the flu, and can be accompanied by a secondary bacter- ial infection. Acute bronchitis resolves within two weeks, although the cough may persist longer. Acute bronchitis, like any upper airway inflammatory process, can increase a person’s likelihood of developing pneumonia. | No
13414 | NarrativeText | Anyone can get acute bronchitis, but infants, young children, and the elderly are more likely to get the dis- ease because people in these age groups generally have weaker immune systems. Smokers and people with heart or other lung diseases are also at higher risk of develop- ing acute bronchitis. Individuals exposed to chemical fumes or high levels of air pollution also have a greater chance of developing acute bronchitis. | No
13415 | NarrativeText | Chronic bronchitis is a major cause of disability and death in the United States. The American Lung Associa- tion estimates that about 14 million Americans suffer from the disease. Like acute bronchitis, chronic bronchi- tis is an inflammation of airways accompanied by cough- ing and spitting up of phlegm. In chronic bronchitis, these symptoms are present for at least three months in each of two consecutive years. | No
13416 | NarrativeText | Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling bronchial irritants, especially cigarette smoke. Until recently, more men than women developed chronic bronchitis, but as the number of women who smoke has increased, so has their rate of chronic bronchitis. Because this disease pro- gresses slowly, middle-aged and older people are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. | No
13417 | NarrativeText | Chronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases that fall under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary dis- ease (COPD). Other diseases in this category include emphysema and chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis may progress to emphysema, or both diseases may be present together. | No

13421 | Title | 598 | No
13422 | NarrativeText | However, the cough soon becomes deep and painful. Coughing brings up a greenish yellow phlegm or sputum. These symptoms may be accompanied by a fever of up to 102°F (38.8°C). Wheezing after coughing is common. | No
13423 | NarrativeText | In uncomplicated acute bronchitis, the fever and most other symptoms, except the cough, disappear after three to five days. Coughing may continue for several weeks. Acute bronchitis is often complicated by a bacter- ial infection, in which case the fever and a general feel- ing of illness persist. To be cured, the bacterial infection should be treated with antibiotics. | No
13424 | Title | Chronic bronchitis | No
13425 | NarrativeText | Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respiratory tract irritants. The most common irritant is cigarette smoke.

Other irritants include chemical fumes, air pollution, and envi- ronmental irritants, such as mold or dust. | No
13426 | NarrativeText | Chronic bronchitis develops slowly over time. The cells that line the respiratory system contain fine, hair- like outgrowths from the cell called cilia. Normally, the cilia of many cells beat rhythmically to move mucus along the airways. When smoke or other irritants are inhaled, the cilia become paralyzed or snap off. When this occurs, the cilia are no longer able to move mucus, and the airways become inflamed, narrowed, and clogged. This leads to difficulty breathing and can progress to the life-threatening disease emphysema. | No
13427 | NarrativeText | A mild cough, sometimes called smokers’ cough, is usually the first visible sign of chronic bronchitis. Coughing brings up phlegm, although the amount varies considerably from person to person. Wheezing and shortness of breath may accompany the cough. Diag- nostic tests show a decrease in lung function. As the dis- ease advances, breathing becomes difficult and activity decreases. The body does not get enough oxygen, lead- ing to changes in the composition of the blood. | No
13428 | Title | Diagnosis | No
13429 | NarrativeText | Initial diagnosis of bronchitis is based on observing the patient’s symptoms and health history. The physician will listen to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope for specific sounds that indicate lung inflammation, such as moist rales and crackling, and wheezing, that indicates airway narrowing. Moist rales is a bubbling sound heard with a stethoscope that is caused by fluid secretion in the bronchial tubes. | No
13430 | NarrativeText | A sputum culture may be performed, particularly if the sputum is green or has blood in it, to determine whether a bacterial infection is present and to identify the disease- causing organism so that an appropriate antibiotic can be selected. Normally, the patient will be asked to cough deeply, then spit the material that comes up from the lungs (sputum) into a cup. This sample is then grown in the labo- ratory to determine which organisms are present. The results are available in two to three days, except for tests for tuberculosis, which can take as long as two months. | No
13431 | NarrativeText | Occasionally, in diagnosing a chronic lung disorder, the sample of sputum is collected using a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, the patient is given a local anesthetic, and a tube is passed into the air- ways to collect a sputum sample. | No
13432 | NarrativeText | A pulmonary function test is important in diagnos- ing chronic bronchitis and other variations of COPD. This test uses an instrument called a spirometer to mea- sure the volume of air entering and leaving the lungs. The test is done in the doctor’s office and is painless. It involves breathing into the spirometer mouthpiece either normally or forcefully. Volumes less than 80% of the normal values indicate an obstructive lung disease. | No
13433 | NarrativeText | To better determine what type of obstructive lung disease a patient has, the doctor may do a chest x ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests. An electrocar- diogram is an instrument that is used to measure the elec- trical activity of the heart and is useful in the diagnosis of heart conditions. Other tests may be used to measure how effectively oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs. | No
13434 | Title | Treatment | No
13435 | Title | Acute bronchitis | No
13436 | NarrativeText | When no secondary infection is present, acute bron- chitis is treated in the same way as the common cold. Home care includes drinking plenty of fluids, resting, not smoking, increasing moisture in the air with a cool mist humidifier, and taking acetaminophen (Datril, Tylenol, Panadol) for fever and pain. Aspirin should not be given to children because of its association with the serious ill- ness, Reye’s syndrome. | No
13437 | NarrativeText | Cough suppressants are used only when the cough is dry and produces no sputum. If the patient is coughing up phlegm, the cough should be allowed to continue. The purpose of the cough it to bring up extra mucus and irri- tants from the lungs. When coughing is suppressed, the mucus accumulates in the plugged airways and can become a breeding ground for pneumonia bacteria. | No
13438 | NarrativeText | Expectorant cough medicines, unlike cough suppres- sants, do not stop the cough. Instead they are used to thin the mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up. This type of cough medicine may be helpful to individuals suf- fering from bronchitis. People who are unsure about what | No

13446 | NarrativeText | If a secondary bacterial infection is present, the infection is treated with an antibiotic. Patients need to take the entire amount of antibiotic prescribed. Stopping the antibiotic early can lead to a return of the infection. Tetracycline or ampicillin are often used to treat adults. Other possibilities include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxa- zole (Bactrim or Septra) and the newer erythromycin- like drugs, such as azithromycin (Zithromax) and clar- ithromycin (Biaxin). Children under age eight are usual- ly given amoxicillin (Amoxil, Pentamox, Sumox, Tri- mox), because tetracycline discolors permanent teeth that have not yet come in. | No

13448 | NarrativeText | The treatment of chronic bronchitis is complex and depends on the stage of chronic bronchitis and whether other health problems are present. Lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke or polluted air, are an important first step. Controlled exer- cise performed on a regular basis is also important. | No
13449 | NarrativeText | Drug therapy begins with bronchodilators. These drugs relax the muscles of the bronchial tubes and allow increased air flow. They can be taken by mouth or inhaled using a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a device that delivers a regulated flow of medication into the airways. | No

13454 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
13455 | NarrativeText | Alternative practitioners focus on prevention by eat- ing a healthy diet that strengthens the immune system and practicing stress management. Bronchitis can become serious if it progresses to pneumonia, therefore, antibi- otics may be required. In addition, however, there are a multitude of botanical and herbal medicines that can be formulated to treat bronchitis. Some examples include inhaling eucalyptus or other essential oils in warm steam. Herbalists recommend a tea made of mullein (Verbascum thapsus), coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), and anise seed (Pimpinella anisum). Homeopathic medicine and tradi- tional Chinese medicine may also be very useful for bronchitis, and hydrotherapy can contribute to cleaning the chest and stimulating immune response. | No
13456 | Title | Prognosis | No
13457 | NarrativeText | When treated, acute bronchitis normally resolves in one to two weeks without complications, although a cough may continue for several more weeks. The pro- gression of chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, may be slowed, and an initial improvement in symptoms may be achieved. Unfortunately, however, there is no cure for chronic bronchitis, and the disease can often lead to or coexist with emphysema. Taken together, all forms of COPD are a leading cause of death. | No
13458 | Title | Prevention | No
13459 | NarrativeText | The best way to prevent bronchitis is not to begin smoking or to stop smoking. Smokers are ten times more likely to die of COPD than non-smokers. Smokers who stop show improvement in lung function. Other preventa- tive steps include avoiding chemical and environmental irritants, such as air pollution, and maintaining good overall health. Immunizations against certain types of pneumonia (as well as influenza) are an important pre- ventative measure for anyone with lung or immune sys- tem diseases. | No

13472 | NarrativeText | Bronchodilators are medicines that help open the bronchial tubes (airways) of the lungs, allowing more air to flow through them. | No
13473 | Title | Purpose | No
13474 | NarrativeText | People with asthma have trouble breathing, because their airways are inflamed and become narrowed. Nor- mally, air moves smoothly from the mouth and nose through the airways and into the tiny air sacs of the lungs as a person breathes in. Breathing out (exhaling) happens automatically when the person stops breathing in. In a person with asthma, breathing in (inhaling) is not a prob- lem. Incoming air can slide around the blockage, because the act of breathing in makes the airways expand. The problem comes when the person with asthma tries to breathe out. The air can no longer get past the blockage, and it remains trapped in the lungs. The person can then only take shallow breaths. Bronchodilators work by relaxing the smooth muscles that line the airways. This makes the airways open wider and allows air to leave the lungs. These drugs also are used to relieve breathing problems associated with emphysema, chronic bronchi- tis, and other lung diseases. | No
13475 | Title | Description | No
13476 | NarrativeText | Some bronchodilators are inhaled, using a nebulizer or an inhalation aerosol. Others are taken as injections or by mouth. Most are available only by prescription, but a few, such as ephedrine, can be bought without a physi- cian’s prescription. Examples of bronchodilators are albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), epinephrine (Primatene), ipratropium (Atrovent), metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), and terbutaline (Brethine). | No
13477 | Title | Recommended dosage | No

13479 | Title | Precautions | No
13480 | NarrativeText | Bronchodilators come with patient instructions. Be sure to carefully read them before using the medicine. If there is any confusion about how to use the medicine, check with the physician or pharmacist. Always use these medicines exactly as directed. Taking larger than recom- mended doses or using the medicine too often can lead to serious side effects and even death. | No
13481 | NarrativeText | If symptoms do not improve or if they get worse after using a bronchodilator, call a physician right away. | No
13482 | NarrativeText | Although some bronchodilators are available with- out a physician’s prescription, these medicines should not be used unless a physician has diagnosed the patient’s condition as asthma. | No
13483 | NarrativeText | Some asthma experts believe that the overuse of bronchodilators can cause asthma to get worse. They advise patients and their physicians to consider control- ling asthma with anti-inflammatory drugs including inhaled steroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate (Beclovent, Vanceril), flunisolide (AeroBid) or triamci- nolone acetonide (Azmacort) Ideally, asthma should be controlled with an inhaled steroid that is used along with the bronchodilator. The more the inhaled steroid steroid controls the inflammation that causes the asthma, the less bronchodilator the patient needs to use because symp- toms are under control. | No
13484 | NarrativeText | Persons with diabetes should be aware that the bron- chodilator epinephrine may raise their blood sugar levels. | No
13485 | NarrativeText | Patients who are using an aerosol bronchodilator and an aerosol form of either ipratropium or a corticosteroid such as beclomethasone dipropionate (Beclovent, Vanceril) should use the bronchodilator first, then wait 5 minutes before using the other medicine. Check with a physician before using any other inhaled medications or other asthma medicines. The physician must determine the proper amount of time between doses. | No
13486 | NarrativeText | Some bronchodilator products contain sulfites, that trigger an allergic reaction in certain people. Anyone who has a sulfite allergy should read the label carefully or check with a physician or pharmacist before using a bronchodilator. Call a physician immediately if any of these signs of an allergic reaction to sulfite occur: + bluish coloration of the skin + flushed or red face or skin | No

Before using these drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of these conditions: ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to any bronchodilator or an inhaled form of any other drug in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances. | No

13536 | Title | Purpose | No
13537 | NarrativeText | During a bronchoscopy, a physician can visually examine the lower airways, including the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The procedure is used to exam- ine the mucosal surface of the airways for abnormalities that might be associated with a variety of lung diseases. Its use includes the visualization of airway obstructions such as a tumor, or the collection of specimens for the diagnosis of cancer originating in the bronchi of the lungs (bronchogenic cancer). It can also be used to collect specimens for culture to diagnose infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. The type of specimens collected can include sputum (composed of saliva and discharges from the respiratory passages), tissue samples from the bronchi or bronchioles, or cells collected from washing the lining of the bronchi or bronchioles. The instrument used in bronchoscopy, a bronchoscope, is a slender cylindrical instrument containing a light and an eyepiece.

It can also be used to col- lect specimens for bacteriological culture to diagnose infec- tious diseases such as tuberculosis. (Il/ustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.) | No
13547 | NarrativeText | tic tube is usually preferred. However, if the purpose of the procedure is to remove a foreign body caught in the wind- pipe or lungs of a child, the more rigid tube must be used because of its larger size. The patient will either lie face-up on his/her back or sit upright in a chair. Medication to decrease secretions, lessen anxiety, and relax the patient are often given prior to the procedure. While breathing through the nose, anesthesia is sprayed into the mouth or nose to numb it. It will take one to two minutes for the anesthesia to take effect. Once this happens, the broncho- scope will be put into the patient’s mouth or nose and moved down into the throat. While the bronchoscope is moving down the throat, additional anesthesia is put into the bronchoscope to numb the lower parts of the airways. Using the eyepiece, the physician then observes the tra- chea and bronchi, and the mucosal lining of these passage- ways, looking for any abnormalities that may be present. | No
13548 | NarrativeText | If the purpose of the bronchoscopy is to take tissue samples or biopsy, forceps or a bronchial brush are used to obtain cells. If the purpose is to identify an infectious agent, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be used to gather fluid for culture purposes. Also, if any foreign matter is found in the airways, it can be removed. | No
13549 | NarrativeText | Another procedure using bronchoscopy is called flu- orescence bronchoscopy. This can be used to detect pre- cancerous cells present in the airways. By using a fluo- rescent light in the bronchoscope, precancerous tissue will appear dark red, while healthy tissue will appear green. This technique can help detect lung cancer at an early stage, so that treatment can be started early. | No
13550 | Title | Alternative procedures | No
13551 | NarrativeText | Depending upon the purpose of the bronchoscopy, alternatives might include a computed tomography scan (CT) or no procedure at all. Bronchoscopy is often per- formed to investigate an abnormality that shows up on a chest x ray or CT scan. If the purpose is to obtain biopsy specimens, one option is to perform surgery, which carries greater risks. Another option is percutaneous (through the skin) biopsy guided by computed tomography. | No
13552 | Title | Preparation | No
13553 | NarrativeText | The doctor should be informed of any allergies and all the medications that the patient is currently taking. The doctor may instruct the patient not to take medications like aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, which interfere with clotting, for a period of time prior to the procedure. The patient needs to fast for 6 to 12 hours prior to the pro- cedure and refrain from drinking any liquids the day of the procedure. The bronchoscopy takes about 45 to 60 minutes, with results usually available in one day. Prior to the bronchoscopy, several tests may be done, including a chest x ray and blood work. Sometimes a bronchoscopy is done under general anesthesia. Patients usually have an intravenous (IV) line in the arm. Most likely, the proce- dure will be done under local anesthesia, which is sprayed into the nose or mouth. This is necessary to decrease the gag reflex. A sedative may also be used to help the patient relax. It is important that the patient understands that at no time will the airway be blocked and that oxygen can be supplied through the bronchoscope. A signed consent form is necessary for this procedure. | No
13554 | Title | Aftercare | No
13555 | NarrativeText | After the bronchoscopy, the patient will be monitored for vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing, while resting in bed. Sometimes patients have an abnormal reaction to anesthesia. All saliva should be spit into a basin so that it can be examined for the pres- ence of blood. If a biopsy was taken, the patient should not cough or clear the throat as this might dislodge any blood clot that has formed and cause bleeding. No food or drink should be consumed for about two hours after the procedure or until the anesthesia wears off. Diet is gradu- ally progressed from ice chips and clear liquids to the patient’s regular diet. There will also be a temporary sore throat and hoarseness that may last for a few days. | No

13563 | NarrativeText | Minor side effects arise from the bronchoscope caus- ing abrasion of the lining of the airways. This results in some swelling and inflammation, as well as hoarseness caused from abrading the vocal cords. If this abrasion is more serious, it can lead to respiratory difficulty or bleed- ing of the airway lining. A more serious risk involved in having a bronchoscopy performed is the occurrence of a pneumothorax, due to puncturing of the lungs, which allows air to escape into the space between the lung and the chest wall. These risks are greater with the use of a rigid bronchoscope than with a fiberoptic bronchoscope. If a rigid tube is used, there is also a risk of chipped teeth. | No

The bronchoscopy may also reveal the presence of abnormal substances in the trachea and bronchi. If sam- ples are taken, the results could indicate cancer, disease- causing agents or other lung disease. Other abnormalities include constriction or narrowing (stenosis), compres- sion, dilation of vessels, or abnormal branching of the bronchi. Abnormal substances that might be found in the airways include blood, secretions, or mucous plugs. Any abnormalities are discussed with the patient. | No

13579 | NarrativeText | Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by members of the Brucella genus that can infect humans but primari- ly infects livestock. Symptoms of the disease include intermittent fever, sweating, chills, aches, and mental depression. The disease can become chronic and recur, particularly if untreated. | No
13580 | Title | Description | No
13581 | NarrativeText | Also known as undulant fever, Malta fever, Gibraltar fever, Bang’s disease, or Mediterranean fever, brucellosis is most likely to occur among those individuals who reg- ularly work with livestock. The disease originated in domestic livestock but was passed on to wild animal species, including the elk and buffalo of the western United States. In humans, brucellosis continues to be spread via unpasteurized milk obtained from infected cows or through contact with the discharges of cattle and goats during miscarriage. In areas of the world where milk is not pasteurized, for example in Latin America and the Mediterranean, the disease is still contracted by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. However, in the United States, the widespread pasteurization of milk and nearly complete eradication of the infection from cattle has reduced the number of human cases from 6,500 in 1940 to about 70 in 1994. | No

13591 | NarrativeText | A human contracts the disease by coming into con- tact with an infected animal and either allowing the bac- teria to enter a cut, breathing in the bacteria, or by con- suming unpasteurized milk or fresh goat cheese obtained from a contaminated animal. In the United States, the disease is primarily confined to slaughterhouse workers. | No
13592 | NarrativeText | Scientists do not agree about whether brucellosis can be transmitted from one person to another, although some people have been infected from a tainted blood transfusion or bone marrow transplant. Newborn babies have also contracted the illness from their mothers dur- ing birth. Currently, it is believed that brucellosis can also be transmitted sexually. | No
13593 | NarrativeText | The disease is not usually fatal, but the intermittent fevers (a source of its nickname, “undulant fever”) can be exhausting. Symptoms usually appear between five days and a month after exposure and begin with a single bout of high fever accompanied by shivering, aching, and drenching sweats that last for a few days. Other symp- toms may include headache, poor appetite, backache, weakness, and depression. Mental depression can be so severe that the patient may become suicidal. | No
13594 | NarrativeText | In rare, untreated cases, the disease can become so severe that it leads to fatal complications, such as pneu- monia or bacterial meningitis. B. melitensis can cause miscarriages, especially during the first three months of pregnancy. The condition can also occur in a chronic form, in which symptoms recur over a period of months or years. | No

13597 | NarrativeText | Brucellosis is usually diagnosed by detecting one or more Brucella species in blood or urine samples. The bacteria may be positively identified using biochemical methods or using a technique whereby, if present in the sample, the brucellosis bacteria are made to fluoresce. Brucellosis may also be diagnosed by culturing and iso- lating the bacteria from one of the above samples. Blood samples will also indicate elevated antibody levels or increased amounts of a protein produced directly in response to infection with brucellosis bacteria. | No

13600 | Title | Prognosis | No
13601 | NarrativeText | Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential to prevent chronic infection. Untreated, the disease may linger for years, but it is rarely fatal. Relapses may also occur. | No
13602 | Title | Prevention | No
13603 | NarrativeText | There is no human vaccine for brucellosis, but humans can be protected by controlling the disease in livestock. After checking to make sure an animal is not already infected, and destroying those that are, all live- stock should be immunized. Butchers and those who work in slaughterhouses should wear protective glasses and clothing, and protect broken skin from infection. | No
13604 | NarrativeText | Some experts suggest that a person with the disease refrain from engaging in unprotected sex until free of the disease. The sexual partners of an infected person should also be closely monitored for signs of infection. | No

13625 | NarrativeText | Bruises, or ecchymoses, are a discoloration and ten- derness of the skin or mucous membranes due to the leakage of blood from an injured blood vessel into the tissues. Pupura refers to bruising as the result of a disease condition. A very small bruise is called a petechia. These often appear as many tiny red dots clustered together, and could indicate a serious problem. | No
13626 | Title | Description | No
13627 | NarrativeText | Bruises change colors over time in a predictable pat- tern, so that it is possible to estimate when an injury occurred by the color of the bruise. Initially, a bruise will be reddish, the color of the blood under the skin. After one to two days, the red blood cells begin to break down, and the bruise will darken to a blue or purplish color. This fades to green at about day six. Around the eighth or ninth day, the skin over the bruised area will have a brown or yellowish appearance, and it will gradually diminish back to its normal color. | No

For instance, bruising in the back of the abdomen may eventually appear in the groin; bruising in the thigh or the knee will work its way down to the ankle. | No
13630 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13631 | NarrativeText | Healthy people may develop bruises from any injury that doesn’t break through the skin. Vigorous exercise may also cause bruises due to bringing about small tears in blood vessels walls. In a condition known as purpura simplex, there is a tendency to bruise easily due to an increased fragility of the blood vessels. Bruises also develop easily in the elderly, because the skin and blood vessels have a tendency to become thinner and more fragile with aging, and there is an increased use of med- ications that interfere with the blood clotting system. In the condition known as purpura senilis, the elderly devel- op bruises from minimal contact that may take up to sev- eral months to completely heal. | No
13632 | NarrativeText | The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) may lead to increased bruising. Aspirin, antidepressants, asthma medications, and cortisone medications also have this effect. The anti-clotting medications also known as blood thinners, especially the drug Warfarin (Coumadin), may be the cause of particularly severe bruising. | No
13633 | NarrativeText | Sometimes bruises are connected with more serious illnesses. There are a number of diseases that cause excessive bleeding or bleeding from injuries too slight to have consequences in healthy people. An abnormal ten- dency to bleed may be due to hereditary bleeding disor- ders, certain prescription medications, diseases of the | No

13635 | NarrativeText | blood such as leukemia, and diseases that increase the fragility of blood vessels. If there are large areas of bruis- ing or bruises develop very easily, this may herald a problem. Other causes that should be ruled out include liver disease, alcoholism, drug addiction, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Bruising that occurs around the navel may indicate dangerous internal bleeding; bruising behind the ear, called Battle’s sign, may be due to a skull fracture; and raised bruises may point to autoimmune disease. | No
13636 | Title | Diagnosis | No
13637 | NarrativeText | Bruising is usually a minor problem, which does not require a medical diagnosis. However, faced with exten- sive bruising, bruising with no apparent cause, or bruis- ing in certain locations, a physician will pursue an evalu- ation that will include a number of blood tests. If the area of the bruise becomes hard, an x ray may be required. | No
13638 | Title | Treatment | No
13639 | NarrativeText | A bruise by itself needs no medical treatment. It is often recommended that ice packs be applied on and off during the first 24 hours of injury to reduce the bruising. After that, heat, especially moist heat, is recommended to increase the circulation and the healing of the injured tissues. Rest, elevation of the effected part, and compres- sion with a bandage will also retard the accumulation of blood. Rarely, if a bruise is so large that the body cannot completely absorb it or if the site becomes infected, it may have to be surgically removed. | No
13640 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
13641 | NarrativeText | Several types of topical applications are usually rec- ommend to speed healing and to reduce the pain associ- ated with bruises. Vitamin K cream can be applied direct- ly to the site of injury. Astringent herbs such as witch hazel, Hamamelis virginiana, can be used. This will tighten the tissues and therefore diminish the bruising. The homeopathic remedy, Arnica montana, can be applied as a cream or gel to unbroken skin. | No
13642 | NarrativeText | Oral homeopathic remedies may reduce bruising, pain, and swelling as well. Arnica montana, at 30 ml (1 oz), taken one to two times per day is highly recom- mended. For ledum, 30 ml (1 0z) one to two times per day is also useful. | No
13643 | Title | Prognosis | No
13644 | NarrativeText | The blood under the skin which causes the discol- oration of bruising should be totally reabsorbed by the body in three weeks or less. At that time, the skin color should completely return to normal. | No
13645 | Title | 608 | No
13646 | NarrativeText | Sometimes, a bruise may become solid and increase in size instead of dissolving. This may indicate blood trapped in the tissues, which may be need to be drained. This is referred to as a hematoma. Less commonly, the body may develop calcium deposits at the injury site in a process called heterotopic ossification. | No
13647 | Title | Prevention | No
13648 | NarrativeText | Vitamin K promotes normal clotting in the blood, and therefore may help reduce the tendency to bruise easily. Green leafy vegetables, alfalfa, broccoli, seaweed, and fish liver oils are dietary sources of vitamin K. Other good foods to eat would be those containing bioflavonoids, such as reddish-blue berries. These can assist in strengthening the connective tissue, which will decrease the spread of blood and bruising. Zinc and vita- min C supplements are also recommended for this. | No

13660 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13661 | NarrativeText | While bruxism is typically associated with stress, it may also be triggered by abnormal occlusion (the way the upper and lower teeth fit together), or crooked or missing teeth. | No
13662 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of bruxism include: dull headaches; sore and tired facial muscles; earaches; sensitive teeth; and locking, popping, and clicking of the jaw. | No
13663 | NarrativeText | During a dental examination, a dentist may recognize damage resulting from bruxism, including: enamel loss from the chewing surfaces of teeth; flattened tooth surfaces; loosened teeth; and fractured teeth and fillings. Left untreat- ed, bruxism may lead to tooth loss and jaw dysfunction. | No
13664 | Title | Diagnosis | No
13665 | NarrativeText | Medical and dental histories and examinations are necessary to differentiate bruxism from other conditions that may cause similar pain, such as ear infections, dental infections, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunc- tion. However, uncommonly worn-down teeth strongly suggest a diagnosis of bruxism. | No
13666 | Title | Treatment | No
13667 | NarrativeText | To prevent further damage to the teeth, bruxism is treated by placing a removable, custom-fitted plastic appliance called a night guard between the upper and lower teeth. Although the clenching and grinding behav- ior may continue, the teeth wear away the plastic instead of each other. | No
13668 | NarrativeText | In some cases, abnormal occlusion may be adjusted and high spots removed so that the teeth fit together in a more comfortable position. Missing teeth may be replaced and crooked teeth may be straightened with orthodontic treatment to eliminate possible underlying causes of bruxism. In cases where jaw muscles are very tight, a dentist may prescribe muscle relaxants. | No
13669 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
13670 | NarrativeText | Stress management and behavior modification tech- niques may be useful to break the habit of clenching and teeth grinding. Tight jaw muscles may be relaxed by applying warm compresses to the sides of the face. Herbal muscle relaxants also can be helpful. Massage therapy and deep tissue realignment, including rolfing, can assist in releasing the clenching pattern. This is a more permanent alternative treatment for bruxism. | No

13700 | NarrativeText | The liver, the largest internal organ in the human body, is responsible for many vital physiologic process- es. Blood flow through the liver nourishes the liver, car- ries in substances that the liver will process, and carries away substances that the liver has produced. When blood cannot flow out freely from the liver, blood pressure rises in the veins of the liver, leading to blood clots within the liver. Also, some of the blood plasma can leak through the walls of the veins and accumulate within the abdomen (ascites). | No
13701 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13702 | NarrativeText | The major symptoms include pain in the upper right-hand portion of the abdomen and a build-up of fluid in the abdomen. In the United States, blood disorders are the most common causes. Among these disorders are polycythemia rubra vera (an increase in the number of red blood cells), and sickle cell disease.

13708 | NarrativeText | Diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can be made by an internist (a specialist in diseases of the internal organs), a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the diseases of the digestive system), or a general surgeon. On physi- cal examination, the doctor will note that the liver is larger than normal. Often an ultrasound scan of the liver will show abnormalities in the size of the liver, an abnor- mal pattern of the veins in the liver, and other abnormali- ties. A CT scan will often show similar abnormalities. | No
13709 | NarrativeText | Once these abnormalities are confirmed, the key test is called hepatic vein catheterization. In this test, a narrow tube is snaked through the body until it reaches the hepat- ic veins. An instrument at the tip of the catheter can mea- sure the pressure within each segment of the hepatic vein. | No
13710 | NarrativeText | In some cases, a tiny amount of radioactive material is injected into a patient, and then an abnormal pattern of radioactivity in the liver can be revealed. In other cases, a liver biopsy enables a physician to examine cells from the liver itself. Cells damaged by Budd-Chiari syndrome have a characteristic appearance easily identifiable to a physician. | No
13711 | Title | Treatment | No
13712 | Title | Surgery | No
13713 | NarrativeText | Most patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome must have surgery. A surgeon will re-route blood flow around the clotted hepatic vein into a large vein called the vena cava. The exact technique will depend on the specific location of the clots and other factors. In certain patients, other surgical techniques may be used. For patients who otherwise would have less than six months to live, liver transplantation is sometimes performed. | No
13714 | NarrativeText | In a few patients, a “balloon catheter” can open the blocked blood vessels, without the need for major surgery. | No
13715 | Title | Drugs | No
13716 | NarrativeText | Sometimes, anti-clotting drugs such as urokinase can be used for patients with a sudden onset of clotting in the veins of the liver. These drugs do not seem to work when the clots have become established. | No

13729 | NarrativeText | The exact cause of Buerger’s disease is not known. It is seen most often in young to middle-aged men (ages 20-40) who are heavy smokers of cigarettes. Cases of this disease in non-smokers are very rare, hence, ciga- rette smoking is considered a causative factor. Approxi- mately 40% of the patients have a history of inflamma- tion of a vein (phlebitis), which may play a role in the development of Buerger’s disease. The disease is mainly seen in the legs of affected persons, but may also appear in their arms. Early symptoms include decrease in the blood supply (arterial ischemia) and superficial (near the skin surface) phlebitis. The main symptom is pain in the affected areas. Onset of the disease is gradual and first occurs in the feet or hands. Inflammation occurs in small and medium-sized arteries and veins near the surface of the limb. In advanced cases, blood vessels in other parts of the body may be affected. There is a progressive decrease in the blood flow to the affected areas. The pulse in arteries of the feet is weak or undetectable. The lack of blood flow can lead to gangrene, which is decay of tissue due to restricted blood supply. A cold sensitivity in the hands, similar to that seen in Raynaud’s disease, can develop. In this case, the hands turn color—white, blue, and then red—when exposed to the cold. | No

13749 | NarrativeText | Bulimia nervosa is a serious and sometimes life- threatening eating disorder affecting mainly young women. People with bulimia, known as bulimics, consume large amounts of food (binge) and then try to rid them- selves of the food and calories (purge) by fasting, exces- sive exercise, vomiting, or using laxatives. The behavior often serves to reduce stress and relieve anxiety. Because bulimia results from an excessive concern with weight control and self-image, and is often accompanied by depression, it is also considered a psychiatric illness. | No
13750 | Title | Description | No
13751 | NarrativeText | Bulimia nervosa is a serious health problem for over two million adolescent girls and young women in the United States. The bingeing and purging activity associ- ated with this disorder can cause severe damage, even death, although the risk of death is not as high as for anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder that leads to exces- sive weight loss. | No
13752 | NarrativeText | Binge eating may in rare instances cause the stom- ach to rupture. In the case of purging, heart failure can result due to loss of vital minerals such as potassium. Vomiting causes other serious problems, including acid- related scarring of the fingers (if used to induce vomit- ing) and damage to tooth enamel. In addition, the tube that brings food from the mouth to the stomach (the esophagus) often becomes inflamed and salivary glands can become swollen. Irregular menstrual periods can also result, and interest in sex may diminish. | No
13753 | NarrativeText | Most bulimics find it difficult to stop their behavior without professional help. Many typically recognize that the behavior is not normal, but feel out of control. Some bulimics struggle with other compulsive, risky behaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse. Many also suffer from other psychiatric illnesses, including clinical depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). | No
13754 | NarrativeText | Most bulimics are females in their teens or early 20s. Males account for only 5-10% of all cases. People of all races develop the disorder, but most of those diagnosed are white. | No
13755 | NarrativeText | Bulimic behavior is often carried out in secrecy, accompanied by feelings of guilt or shame. Outwardly, many people with bulimia appear healthy and successful, while inside they have feelings of helplessness and low self-esteem. | No

Environmental influences include participation in work or sports that emphasize thinness, such as modeling, dancing, or gymnastics. Fam- ily pressures also may play a role. One study found that mothers who are extremely concerned about their daugh- ters’ physical attractiveness and weight may help to cause bulimia. In addition, girls with eating disorders tend to have fathers and brothers who criticize their weight. | No

13768 | NarrativeText | Bulimia is treated most successfully when diag- nosed early. But because the bulimic may deny there is a problem, getting medical help is often delayed. A com- plete physical examination in order to rule out other ill- nesses is the first step to diagnosis. | No
13769 | NarrativeText | According to the American Psychiatric Association, a diagnosis of bulimia requires that a person have all of the following symptoms: * recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum average of two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three months) | No
13770 | ListItem | ea feeling of lack of control over eating during the binges * regular use of one or more of the following to prevent weight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives or diuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous exercise | No

13772 | Title | Treatment | No
13773 | NarrativeText | Early treatment is important otherwise bulimia may become chronic, with serious health consequences. A comprehensive treatment plan is called for in order to address the complex interaction of physical and psycho- logical problems in bulimia. A combination of drug and behavioral therapies is commonly used. | No
13774 | NarrativeText | Behavioral approaches include individual psychother- apy, group therapy, and family therapy. Cognitive- behavioral therapy, which teaches patients how to change abnormal thoughts and behavior, is also used. Nutrition counseling and self-help groups are often helpful. | No
13775 | NarrativeText | Antidepressants commonly used to treat bulimia include desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil), and fluoxetine (Prozac). These medications also may treat any co-existing depression. | No
13776 | NarrativeText | In addition to professional treatment, family support plays an important role in helping the bulimic person. Encouragement and caring can provide the support needed to convince the sick person to get help, stay with treatment, or try again after a failure. Family members can help locate resources, such as eating disorder clinics in local hospitals or treatment programs in colleges designed for students. | No
13777 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
13778 | NarrativeText | Light therapy—exposure to bright, artificial light— may be useful in reducing bulimic episodes, especially during the dark winter months. Some feel that massage may prove helpful, putting people in touch with the reali- ty of their own bodies and correcting misconceptions of body image. Hypnotherapy may help resolve uncon- scious issues that contribute to bulimic behavior. | No

13815 | Title | Description | No
13816 | NarrativeText | Bundle branch block belongs to a group of heart prob- lems called intraventricular conduction defects (IVCD). There are two bundle branches, right and left. The right bundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of the right ventricle (the lower chamber of the heart) and the left bundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of the left ventricle. The two bundles initially are together at a junction called the bundle of His. Nerve impulses come through the sinus node of the heart to the bundle of His and then move into the right and left bundle branches. Bundle branch block is a slowing or interruption of nerve impulses. A problem may exist in any of the three bundles. | No
13817 | NarrativeText | Patients with BBB are generally without symptoms unless the disease is severe enough to cause a complete infranodal A-V block and very slow heart rate. In patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB), the nerve impulse is conducted slowly or not at all. The right ventricle finally receives the impulse through muscle-to-muscle spread, outside the regular nerve pathway. This mechanism of impulse transmission is slow and results in a delayed con- traction of the right ventricle. There are several types of left bundle branch block (LBBB), each producing its own characteristic mechanism of failure. In each case, the nerve impulse is blocked or delayed. Patients with LBBB may have left ventricular disease or cardiomyopathy. | No
13818 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13819 | NarrativeText | Left bundle branch block usually happens as a con- sequence of other diseases such as arteriosclerosis, rheumatic fever, congenital heart disease, myocardi- tis, myocardial infarction, metastatic heart tumors, or other invasions of the heart tissue. Right bundle branch block happens less often from underlying heart disease. | No

The pat- tern seen in the electrocardiogram indicates pulses in a heart beat and their duration. A QRS duration of greater than 110 milliseconds is a diagnostic indication of BBB. There is a unique ECG pattern for blocks in each of the three bundles. | No

13825 | NarrativeText | There is no specific therapy for BBB. Patients are usually treated for associated heart diseases. | No
13826 | Title | Prognosis | No
13827 | NarrativeText | The prognosis of blockage in any of the three bundle branches depends on the prognosis of the associated heart disease. The associated diseases determine the outcome of the patient’s health. Occasionally, disruptions in bundle branches lead to complete infranodal A-V block, a more serious blockage of nerve impulses. Approximately 2% of patients with BBB develop infranodal A-V blockage and these patients often require artificial pacemakers. | No

13835 | NarrativeText | A bunion is an abnormal enlargement of the joint (the first metatarsophalangeal joint, or MTPJ) at the base of the great or big toe (hallux). It is caused by inflamma- tion and usually results from chronic irritation and pres- sure from poorly fitting footwear. | No
13836 | Title | Description | No
13837 | NarrativeText | A displacement of two major bones of the foot (hal- lux valgus) causes bunions, although not everyone with this displacement will develop the joint swelling and bone overgrowth that characterize a bunion. One of the bones involved is called the first metatarsal bone. This bone is long and slender, with the big toe attached on one end and the other end connected to foot bones closer to the ankle. This foot bone is displaced in the direction of the four other metatarsals connected with the toes. The other bone involved is the big toe itself, which is dis- placed toward the smaller toes. As the big toe continues to move toward the smaller toes, it may become dis- placed under or over the second toe. The displacement of these two foot bones causes a projection of bone on the inside portion of the forefoot. The skin over this projec- tion often becomes inflamed from rubbing against the shoe, and a callus may form. | No
13838 | NarrativeText | The joint contains a small sac (bursa) filled with fluid that cushions the bones and helps the joint to move smoothly. When a bunion forms, this sac becomes inflamed and thickened. The swelling in the joint causes additional pain and pressure in the toe. | No
13839 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13840 | NarrativeText | Bunions may form as a result of abnormal motion of the foot during walking or running. One common exam- ple of an abnormal movement is an excessive amount of stress placed upon the inside of the foot. This leads to friction and irritation of the involved structures. Age has also been noted as a factor in developing bunions, in part because the underlying bone displacement worsens over time unless corrective measures are taken. | No
13841 | NarrativeText | Wearing improperly fitting shoes, especially those with a narrow toe box and excessive heel height, often causes the formation of a bunion. This forefoot deformity is seen more often in women than men. The higher fre- quency in females may be related to the strong link between footwear fashion and bunions. In fact, in a recent survey of more than 350 women, nearly 90% wore shoes that were at least one size too small or too narrow. | No
13842 | NarrativeText | Because genetic factors can predispose people to the hallux valgus bone displacement, a strong family history of bunions can increase the likelihood of developing this foot disorder. Various arthritic conditions and several genetic and neuromuscular diseases, such as Down syn- drome and Marfan syndrome, cause muscle imbal- ances that can create bunions from displacement of the first metatarsal and big toe. Other possible causes of bunions are leg-length discrepancies, with the bunion present on the longer leg, and trauma occurring to the joint of the big toe. | No
13843 | NarrativeText | Symptoms of bunions include the common signs of inflammation such as redness, swelling, and pain. The discomfort is primarily located along the inside of the foot just behind the big toe. Because of friction, a callus may develop over the bunion. If an overlapping of the toes is allowed, additional rubbing and pain occurs. | No

13845 | NarrativeText | Inflammation of this area causes a decrease in motion with associated discomfort in the joint between the big toe and the first metatarsal. If allowed to worsen, the skin over the bunion may break down causing an ulcer, which also presents a problem of potential infection. (Foot ulcers can be particularly dangerous for people with dia- betes, who may have trouble feeling the ulcer forming and healing if it becomes infected.) | No
13846 | Title | Diagnosis | No
13847 | NarrativeText | A thorough medical history and physical exam by a physician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis of bunions and other foot conditions. X rays can help con- firm the diagnosis by showing the bone displacement, joint swelling, and, in some cases, the overgrowth of bone that characterizes bunions. Doctors will also con- sider the possibility that the joint pain is caused by or complicated by arthritis (which causes destruction of the cartilage of the joint), gout (which causes the accumula- tion of uric acid crystals in the joint), tiny fractures of a bone in the foot (stress fractures), or infection and may order additional tests to rule out these possibilities. | No
13848 | Title | Treatment | No
13849 | Title | Conservative | No
13850 | NarrativeText | The first step in treating a bunion is to remove as much pressure from the area as possible. People with bunions should wear shoes that have enough room in the toe box to accommodate the bunion and avoid high-heeled shoes and tight-fitting socks or stockings. Dressings and pads help protect the bunion from additional shoe pres- sure. The application of splints or customized shoe inserts (orthotics) to correct the alignment of the big toe joint is effective for many bunions. Most patients are instructed to | No

13857 | Title | Surgery | No
13858 | NarrativeText | If conservative treatment is not successful, surgical removal of the bunion may be necessary to correct the deformity. This procedure is called a bunionectomy, and there are many variations on the operation, which is usu- ally performed by a surgeon who specializes in treating bone conditions (orthopedics) or by one who specializes in treating the foot (podiatry). Surgeons consider the angle of the bone misalignment, the condition of the bursa, and the strength of the bones when they choose which procedure to use. Most bunionectomies involve the removal of a section of bone and the insertion of pins to rejoin the bone. Sometimes the surgeons may move ligaments (which connect bone to bone in the joint) or tendons (which connect bone to muscle) in order to realign the bones. After this procedure, the bones and other tissues are held in place while they heal by com- pression dressings or a short cast. The individual must refrain from vigorous exercise for six weeks. | No

A second-degree burn involves redness, swelling and blistering, and the damage may extend beneath the epidermis to deeper layers of skin (dermis). A third- degree burn, also called a full-thickness burn, destroys the entire depth of skin, causing significant scarring. Damage also may extend to the underlying fat, muscle, or bone. | No
13882 | NarrativeText | The severity of the burn is also judged by the amount of body surface area (BSA) involved. Health care workers use the “rule of nines” to determine the percent- age of BSA affected in patients more than 9 years old: each arm with its hand is 9% of BSA; each leg with its foot is 18%; the front of the torso is 18%; the back of the torso, including the buttocks, is 18%; the head and neck are 9%; and the genital area (perineum) is 1%. This rule cannot be applied to a young child’s body proportions, so BSA is estimated using the palm of the patient’s hand as a measure of 1% area. | No
13883 | NarrativeText | on less than 2% BSA. Moderate burns should be treated at a hospital. These are defined as first- or second-degree burns covering 15%-25% of an adult’s body or 10%-20% of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on 2%-10% BSA. Critical, or major, burns are the most serious and should be treated in a specialized burn unit of a hospital. These are defined as first- or second-degree burns cover- ing more than 25% of an adult’s body or more than 20% of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on more than 10% BSA. In addition, burns involving the hands, feet, face, eyes, ears, or genitals are considered critical. Other factors influence the level of treatment needed, including associated injuries such as bone fractures and smoke inhalation, presence of a chronic disease, or a history of being abused. Also, children and the elderly are more vulnerable to complications from burn injuries and require more intensive care. | No
13884 | NarrativeText | The severity of the burn will determine not only the type of treatment, but also where the burn patient should receive treatment. Minor burns may be treated at home or in a doctor’s office.

13895 | NarrativeText | In situations where a person has received moderate or critical burns, lifesaving measures take precedence over burn treatment and emergency medical assistance must be called. A person with serious burns may stop breathing, and artificial respiration (also called mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or rescue breathing) should be administered immediately. Also, a person with burns covering more than 12% BSA is likely to go into shock; this condition may be prevented by laying the person flat and elevating the feet about 12 in (30 cm).

13897 | NarrativeText | Burn treatment consists of relieving pain, preventing infection, and maintaining body fluids, electrolytes, and calorie intake while the body heals. Treatment of chemi- cal or electrical burns is slightly different from the treat- ment of thermal burns but the objectives are the same. | No
13898 | Title | Thermal burn treatment | No
13899 | NarrativeText | In rescues, a blanket may be used to smother any flames as the person is removed from danger. The person whose clothing is on fire should “stop, drop, and roll” or be assisted in lying flat on the ground and rolling to put out the fire. Afterwards, only burnt clothing that comes off easily should be removed; any clothing embedded in the burn should not be disturbed. Removing any smol- dering apparel and covering the person with a light, cool, wet cloth, such as a sheet but not a blanket or towel, will stop the burning process. | No
13900 | NarrativeText | The first act of thermal burn treatment is to stop the burning process. This may be accomplished by letting cool water run over the burned area or by soaking it in cool (not cold) water. Ice should never be applied to the burn. Cool (not cold) wet compresses may provide some pain relief when applied to small areas of first- and second-degree burns. Butter, shortening, or similar salve should never be applied to the burn since it prevents heat from escaping and drives the burning process deeper into the skin. | No
13901 | NarrativeText | If the burn is minor, it may be cleaned gently with soap and water. Blisters should not be broken. If the skin of the burned area is unbroken and it is not likely to be further irritated by pressure or friction, the burn should be left exposed to the air to promote healing. If the skin is broken or apt to be disturbed, the burned area should be coated lightly with an antibacterial ointment and cov- ered with a sterile bandage. Aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) may be taken to ease pain At the hospital, the staff will provide further med- ical treatment. A tube to aid breathing may be inserted if the patient’s airways or lungs have been damaged, as can happen during an explosion or a fire in a enclosed space. Also, because burns dramatically deplete the body of fluids, replacement fluids are administered intravenously. The patient is also given antibiotics intra- venously to prevent infection, and he or she may also receive a tetanus shot, depending on his or her immu- nization history. Once the burned area is cleaned and treated with antibiotic cream or ointment, it is covered in sterile bandages, which are changed two to three times a day. Surgical removal of dead tissue (debride- ment) also takes place. As the burns heal, thick, taut scabs (eschar) form, which the doctor may have to cut to improve blood flow to the more elastic healthy tissue beneath. The patient will also undergo physical and | No

13904 | NarrativeText | In cases where the skin has been so damaged that it cannot properly heal, a skin graft is usually performed. A skin graft involves taking a piece of skin from an unburned portion of the patient’s body (autograft) and transplanting it to the burned area. When doctors cannot immediately use the patient’s own skin, a temporary graft is performed using the skin of a human donor (allograft), either alive or dead, or the skin of an animal (xenograft), usually that of a pig. | No
13905 | NarrativeText | The burn victim also may be placed in a hyperbaric chamber, if one is available. In a hyperbaric chamber (which can be a specialized room or enclosed space), the patient is exposed to pure oxygen under high pressure, which can aid in healing. However, for this therapy to be effective, the patient must be placed in a chamber within 24 hours of being burned. | No
13906 | Title | Chemical burn treatment | No
13907 | NarrativeText | Burns from liquid chemicals must be rinsed with cool water for at least 15 minutes to stop the burning process. Any burn to the eye must be similarly flushed with water. In cases of burns from dry chemicals such as lime, the powder should be completely brushed away before the area is washed. Any clothing which may have absorbed the chemical should be removed. The burn should then be loosely covered with a sterile gauze pad and the person taken to the hospital for further treatment. A physician may be able to neutralize the offending chemical with another before treating the burn like a thermal burn of similar severity. | No
13908 | Title | Electrical burn treatment | No
13909 | NarrativeText | Before electrical burns are treated at the site of the accident, the power source must be disconnected if possi- ble and the victim moved away from it to keep the person giving aid from being electrocuted. Lifesaving measures again take priority over burn treatment, so breathing must be checked and assisted if necessary. Electrical burns should be loosely covered with sterile gauze pads and the person taken to the hospital for further treatment. | No
13910 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
13911 | NarrativeText | In addition to the excellent treatment of burns pro- vided by traditional medicine, some alternative approaches may be helpful as well. (Major burns should always be treated by a medical practitioner.) The homeo- pathic remedies Cantharis and Causticum can assist in burn healing. A number of botanical remedies, applied topically, can also help burns heal. These include aloe | No

13918 | Title | Prognosis | No
13919 | NarrativeText | The prognosis is dependent upon the degree of the burn, the amount of body surface covered, whether criti- cal body parts were affected, any additional injuries or complications like infection, and the promptness of med- ical treatment. Minor burns may heal in five to 10 days with no scarring. Moderate burns may heal in 10-14 days and may leave scarring. Critical or major burns take more than 14 days to heal and will leave significant scar- ring. Scar tissue may limit mobility and functionality, but physical therapy may overcome these limitations. In some cases, additional surgery may be advisable to remove scar tissue and restore appearance. | No

13938 | Title | Definition | No
13939 | NarrativeText | Bursitis is the painful inflammation of the bursa, a padlike sac found in areas subject to friction. Bursae cushion the movement between the bones, tendons and muscles near the joints. Bursitis is most often caused by repetitive movement and is known by several common names including weaver’s bottom, clergyman’s knee, and miner’s elbow, depending on the affected individual’s occupation and area of injury. | No
13940 | Title | 620 | No
13941 | Title | Description | No
13942 | NarrativeText | There are over 150 bursae in the human body. Usual- ly bursae are present from birth, but they may form in response to repeated pressure. Each sac contains a small amount of synovial fluid, a clear liquid that acts as a lubricant. Inflammation causes pain on movement. The most common site for bursitis to occur is the shoulder (subdeltoid), but it also is seen in the elbows (olecranon), hips (trochanteric), knees, heels (Achilles), and toes. The affected area may be referred to as “frozen,” because movement is so limited. In the knee there are four bursae, and all can become inflamed with overuse. | No
13943 | Title | Causes and symptoms | No
13944 | NarrativeText | The most common cause of bursitis is repeated physical activity, but it can flare up for no known reason. It can also be caused by trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and acute or chronic infection. | No
13945 | NarrativeText | Pain and tenderness are common symptoms. If the affected joint is close to the skin, as with the shoulder, knee, elbow, or Achilles tendon, swelling and redness are seen and the area may feel warm to the touch. The bursae around the hip joint are deeper, and swelling is not obvi- ous. Movement may be limited and is painful. In the shoulder, it may be difficult to raise the arm out from the side of the body. Putting on a jacket or combing the hair becomes a troublesome activity. | No
13946 | NarrativeText | In acute bursitis symptoms appear suddenly; with chronic bursitis, pain, tenderness, and limited movement reappear after exercise or strain. | No
13947 | Title | Diagnosis | No
13948 | NarrativeText | When a patient has pain in a joint, a careful physical examination is needed to determine what type of move- ment is affected and if there is any swelling present. Bur- sitis will not show up on x-rays, although sometimes there are also calcium deposits in the joint that can be seen. Inserting a thin needle into the affected bursa and removing (aspirating) some of the synovial fluid for examination can confirm the diagnosis. In most cases, the fluid will not be clear. It can be tested for the pres- ence of microorganisms, which would indicate an infec- tion, and crystals, which could indicate gout. In instances where the diagnosis is difficult, a local anesthetic (a drug that numbs the area) is injected into the painful spot. If the discomfort stops temporarily, then bursitis is proba- bly the correct diagnosis. | No
13949 | Title | Treatment | No
13950 | NarrativeText | Conservative treatment of bursitis is usually effec- tive. The application of heat, rest, and immobilization of the affected joint area is the first step. A sling can be used for a shoulder injury; a cane is helpful for hip problems. The patient can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofin, and naproxen. They can be obtained without a prescription and relieve the pain and inflammation. Once the pain decreases, exercises of the affected area can begin. If the nearby muscles have become weak because of the disease or prolonged immobility, then exercises to build strength and improve movement are best. A doctor or physical therapist can prescribe an effective regimen. | No
13951 | NarrativeText | If the bursitis is related to an inflammatory condition like arthritis or gout, then management of that disease is needed to control the bursitis. | No
13952 | NarrativeText | When bursitis does not respond to conservative treatment, an injection into the joint of a long-acting cor- ticosteroid preparation, like prednisone, can bring imme- diate and lasting relief. A corticosteroid is a hormonal substance that is the most effective drug for reducing inflammation. The drug is mixed with a local anesthetic and works on the joint within five minutes. Usually one injection is all that is needed. | No
13953 | NarrativeText | Surgery to remove the damaged bursa may be per- formed in extreme cases. | No
13954 | NarrativeText | If the bursitis is caused by an infection, then addi- tional treatment is needed. Septic bursitis is caused by the presence of a pus-forming organism, usually staphylococ- cus aureus. This is confirmed by examining a sample of the fluid in the bursa and requires treatment with antibi- otics taken by mouth, injected into a muscle or into a vein (intravenously). The bursa will also need to be drained by needle two or three times over the first week of treatment. When a patient has such a serious infection, there may be underlying causes. There could be undiscovered diabetes, or an inefficient immune system caused by human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). | No
13955 | Title | Alternative treatment | No
13956 | NarrativeText | Alternative treatments take into consideration the role of diet in causing bursitis. The faulty use of calcium by the body, magnesium deficiency, and food allergies may have a role. Diet changes and vitamin supplements may be helpful. The use of herbs, homeopathy, aro- matherapy, and hydrotherapy can help relieve symp- toms. Ginger is useful in reducing inflammation. Acupuncture has been proven effective in treating hip and shoulder pain caused by bursitis and other condi- tions. Other therapies that deal effectively with muscu- loskeletal problems (relating to the muscles and skele- ton), may also be helpful, such as body work, magnetic field therapy, naturopathic medicine, chiropractic, and applied kinesiology. | No

13965 | Title | Prevention | No
13966 | NarrativeText | Aggravating factors should be eliminated to prevent bursitis. Overexercising or the repetition of a movement that triggers the condition should be avoided. Doing exer- cises to strengthen the muscles around the joint will also help. When doing repetitive tasks, frequent breaks should be taken and the activity should be alternated with others using different parts of the body. To cushion the joints, it is a good idea to use cushioned chairs when sitting and foam kneeling pads for the knees. Leaning on the elbows, kneeling or sitting on a hard surface for a long period of time should be avoided. Not wearing high heels can help prevent bursitis in the heel, as can changing to new run- ning shoes as soon as the old ones are worn out. | No

13981 | Title | Description | No
13982 | NarrativeText | Although inhaling cotton dust was identified as a source of respiratory disease more than 300 years ago, byssinosis has been recognized as an occupational haz- ard for textile workers for less than 50 years. More than 800,000 workers in the cotton, flax, and rope-making industries are exposed in the workplace to airborne parti- cles that can cause byssinosis. Only workers in mills that manufacture yarn, thread, or fabric have a significant risk of dying of this disease. | No
13983 | NarrativeText | In the United States, byssinosis is almost completely limited to workers who handle unprocessed cotton. More than 35,000 textile workers have been disabled by byssi- nosis and 183 died between 1979 and 1992. Most of the people whose deaths were due to byssinosis lived in the textile-producing regions of North and South Carolina. | No

13986 | NarrativeText | As many as 25% of workers with byssinosis have symptoms that continue or recur throughout the work- week. More severe breathing problems seem to result both from exposure to high levels of dust and from longer dust exposure. Workers who also smoke cigarettes suffer the most severe impairment. | No

13993 | NarrativeText | Therapy for early-stage byssinosis focuses on reversing airway narrowing. Antihistamines may be pre- scribed to reduce tightness in the chest. Bronchodilators (drugs used to relax breathing passages and improve air flow) may be used with an inhaler or taken in tablet form. Reducing exposure is essential. Any worker who has symptoms of byssinosis or who has trouble breathing should transfer to a less-contaminated area. | No
13994 | Title | Prognosis | No
13995 | NarrativeText | Smoking, impaired lung function, and a history of respiratory allergy increase a textile worker’s risk of devel- oping byssinosis. Prolonged exposure makes patients wheeze more often and can cause chronic bronchitis. It does not lead to permanently disabling lung disease. | No
13996 | Title | Prevention | No
13997 | NarrativeText | Eliminating exposure to textile dust is the surest way to prevent byssinosis. Using exhaust hoods, improving ventilation, and employing wetting procedures are very successful methods of controlling dust levels to prevent byssinosis. Protective equipment required during certain procedures also prevents exposure to levels of contami- nation that exceed the current United States standard for cotton dust exposure. | No
