1963 | BLOOD TESTS (SEROLOGY). The first blood test for AIDS was developed in 1985. At present, patients who are being tested for HIV infection are usually given an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for the presence of HIV antibody in their blood. Positive ELISA results are then tested with a Western blot or immunofluo- rescence (IFA) assay for confirmation. The combination of the ELISA and Western blot tests is more than 99.9% | %
2205 | The “hairbulb pigmentation test” is used to identify carriers by incubating a piece of the person’s hair in a solution of tyrosine, a substance in food which the body uses to make melanin. If the hair turns dark, it means the hair is making melanin (a “positive” test); light hair means there is no melanin. This test is the source of the names of two types of albinism: “ty-pos” and “‘ty-neg.” | ”
2330 | Alcohol abuse requires that one of the following four criteria is met. Because of drinking, a person repeatedly: * Do you ever need an Eye-opener (a morning drink of alcohol) to start the day)? | ?
2338 | One very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of alcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consists of four questions, with the first letters of each key word spelling out the word CAGE: « Have you ever tried to Cut down on your drinking? | ?
2478 | In patients with high tumor burden (a large number of circulating malignant B cells) this drug can cause a side effect called tumor lysis syndrome. Thought to be due to the release of the lysed cells’ contents into the blood stream, it can cause a misbalance of urea, uric acid, phosphate, potassium, and calcium in the urine and blood. Patients at risk for this side effect must keep hydrated and can be given allopurinol before infusion. anbiuypa} | }
2487 | Because the Alexander technique helps students improve overall functioning, both mental and physical, it offers a wide range of benefits. Nikolaas Tinbergen, in his 1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the “striking improvements in such diverse things as high blood pressure, breathing, depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and mental alertness, resilience against outside pressures, and the refined skill of playing a musical instrument.” He went on to quote a list of other conditions helped by the Alexander tech- nique: “rheumatism, including various forms of arthritis, then respiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal asth- ma; following in their wake, circulation defects, which may lead to high blood pressure and also to some danger- ous heart conditions; gastrointestinal disorders of many types, various gynecological conditions, sexual failures, migraines and depressive states.” | ”
2958 | In RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in the laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum is separated from the blood cells. The serum is then exposed to allergens bound to a solid medium. If a per- son has antibodies to a particular allergen, those antibod- rest 2 | 2

8746 | Physiological reactions to chemicals, including those associated with nutrition and allergies, may also be evaluated using AK. The AK protocol for testing chemi- cal compounds is to place the substance on the patient’s tongue so that he tastes the material, and the normal chemical reactions of ingestion begin. In some cases, the substances are inhaled through the nose. The AK practi- tioner then tests the associated muscle-organ pattern to determine where or if there is a strength or weakness. The patient does not need to swallow the substance for a change in strength or weakness to be identified. David S. Walther, a diplomate of the International College of Applied Kinesiology, has indicated that “it is possible that the central nervous system, recognizing the com- pound being ingested, relays information to the organs and glands preparing for use of the compound. If the compound is recognized as beneficial, the energy pattern is immediately enhanced, influencing not only the organ or gland, but also the associated muscle.” | ”
8841 | review published in 1999 by researchers from the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conserva- tive Therapies Research in Chapel Hill stated that, although AK appears to be a promising methodology, there is a lack of research results relevant to clinical practice and outcomes of AK care. They found this lack of results surprising, since cost, satisfaction, uti- lization, and changes in symptoms are the important results of clinical practice. In addition, they determined that some studies that were supposed to be an evalua- tion of AK procedures did not actually use clinical practices and principles of AK. However, from studies adhering to AK principles and employing standardized training by well-trained practitioners, they did state there was some evidence that AK is an objectively veri- fiable phenomenon. They suggested that “future stud- ies of AK should focus on outcomes of care, including symptoms, function, costs, and safety. Only well- designed studies that account for the individual nature of AK diagnosis and treatment and preserve the proper clinical context of AK treatment will be informative. Understanding the individual components of the process of AK treatment remains important. Studies addressing validation of isolated AK procedures need to meet the methodological challenges of studying appropriate subjects that reflects the current recog- nized practice and understanding of AK. Further evalu- ation of the basic physiologic phenomena involved and correlation of AK manual muscle test results will also advance understanding of this diagnostic and therapeu- tic system.” | ”

10869 | To understand Ayurvedic treatment, it is necessary to have an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the body. The basic life force in the body is prana, which is also found in the elements and is similar to the Chinese notion of chi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi and expert, put it, “Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen, nor any of its chemical constituents. It is in food, water, and in the sunlight, yet it is not vitamin, heat, or light- rays. Food, water, air, etc., are only the media through which the prana is carried.” | ”
