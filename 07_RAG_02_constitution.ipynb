Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific proteins.

      "Employment can also factor into a woman’s decision to breastfeed or her ability to maintain the practice. Employed mothers have been less likely to initiate breastfeeding and tend to breastfeed for a shorter period of time than new mothers who are not employed or who have lengthy maternity leaves. In 2010 in the United States, the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required most employers to provide accommodations within the workplace for new mothers to pump breast milk. This law requires a private and clean space within the workplace, other than a restroom, along with adequate break time for a woman to express milk.5It also requires health insurance to cover certain breastfeeding services and supplies such as a breast pump. Additionally, the Hawai‘i State Legislature has passed several bills to support breastfeeding. These bills provide a number of rights to breastfeeding women in Hawai‘i. These include: the right to breastfeed in public, the right to pump breastmilk at work (extending beyond the ACA worksite protections), protection from an employer from firing or penalizing a lactating employee because the employee breastfeeds or expresses milk at the workplace,6 and the right for breastfeeding mothers to decline jury duty until the 5. US Department of Health and Human Services. (2011, January 20). Executive summary: The Surgeon General’s call to action to support breastfeeding.\n",

      "The Health At Every Size® Principles are: 1. Weight Inclusivity: Accepting and respecting the diversity of body shapes and sizes 2. Health Enhancement: Recognizing that health and well-being are multi-dimensional and that they include physical, social, spiritual, occupational, emotional, and intellectual aspects 3. Respectful Care: Promoting all aspects of health and well- being for people of all sizes 4. Eating for Well-being: Promoting eating in a manner which balances individualized nutritional needs, hunger, satiety, appetite, and pleasure 5. Life-Enhancing Movement: Promoting individually appropriate, enjoyable, life-enhancing physical activity, rather than exercise that is focused on a goal of weight loss In the Hawaiian language, Lokahi means “unity, agreement, accord, and harmony”.23  The concept of Lokahi can be used to describe the balance between the relationship an individual has with the body, the mind, the spirit, and the rest of the world. The image below illustrates the overlap of the Hawaiian principle of Lokahi with the Health at Every Size principle #2:  Health enhancement. 23. Ulukau Hawaiian Electronic Library. http://wehewehe.org/ 1072 | Calories In Versus Calories Out\n",

      "Employment can also factor into a woman’s decision to breastfeed or her ability to maintain the practice. Employed mothers have been less likely to initiate breastfeeding and tend to breastfeed for a shorter period of time than new mothers who are not employed or who have lengthy maternity leaves. In 2010 in the United States, the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required most employers to provide accommodations within the workplace for new mothers to pump breast milk. This law requires a private and clean space within the workplace, other than a restroom, along with adequate break time for a woman to express milk.5It also requires health insurance to cover certain breastfeeding services and supplies such as a breast pump. Additionally, the Hawai‘i State Legislature has passed several bills to support breastfeeding. These bills provide a number of rights to breastfeeding women in Hawai‘i. These include: the right to breastfeed in public, the right to pump breastmilk at work (extending beyond the ACA worksite protections), protection from an employer from firing or penalizing a lactating employee because the employee breastfeeds or expresses milk at the workplace,6 and the right for breastfeeding mothers to decline jury duty until the 5. US Department of Health and Human Services.

      "The Health At Every Size® Principles are: 1. Weight Inclusivity: Accepting and respecting the diversity of body shapes and sizes 2. Health Enhancement: Recognizing that health and well-being are multi-dimensional and that they include physical, social, spiritual, occupational, emotional, and intellectual aspects 3. Respectful Care: Promoting all aspects of health and well- being for people of all sizes 4. Eating for Well-being: Promoting eating in a manner which balances individualized nutritional needs, hunger, satiety, appetite, and pleasure 5. Life-Enhancing Movement: Promoting individually appropriate, enjoyable, life-enhancing physical activity, rather than exercise that is focused on a goal of weight loss In the Hawaiian language, Lokahi means “unity, agreement, accord, and harmony”.23  The concept of Lokahi can be used to describe the balance between the relationship an individual has with the body, the mind, the spirit, and the rest of the world.

    "You are an expert assistant trained to provide clear, detailed, and well-structured explanations. Follow these steps to generate the best possible answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Relevant Passages:** Identify and extract key information from the provided context that directly relates to the user's query.\n",
    "2. **Formulate a Detailed Answer:** Using the extracted information, craft an informative and well-structured response that is clear, concise, and explanatory.  \n",
    "3. **Maintain the Ideal Answer Style:** Follow the example responses below to ensure your answer is detailed, accurate, and engaging.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "**Query:** What are the fat-soluble vitamins?  \n",
    "**Answer:** The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fats and stored in the body's fatty tissues and liver. Each plays a distinct role: Vitamin A supports vision and immune function, Vitamin D aids calcium absorption and bone health, Vitamin E protects cells from oxidative stress, and Vitamin K is crucial for blood clotting and bone strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "**Query:** What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?  \n",
    "**Answer:** Type 2 diabetes is linked to lifestyle factors such as excessive caloric intake, poor diet, and lack of physical activity. Diets rich in refined sugars and unhealthy fats contribute to insulin resistance, where cells no longer respond effectively to insulin. Over time, this impairs the pancreas’s ability to regulate blood sugar, leading to type 2 diabetes. Maintaining a balanced diet and staying active can significantly reduce this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3:\n",
    "**Query:** What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?  \n",
    "**Answer:** Hydration is vital for physical performance as water maintains blood volume, regulates body temperature, and facilitates nutrient and oxygen delivery. Proper hydration supports muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Without adequate water intake, dehydration can cause fatigue, cramps, and reduced performance. To optimize physical performance, it's important to drink water before, during, and after exercise.\n",
